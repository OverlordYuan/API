网站,"Apple, Google, Amazon eye common standard for smart home devices","Will Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri and Google Assistant finally get along?   The major digital assistants could operate on a common technology standard under a plan announced Wednesday by Amazon, Apple and Google and other industry partners that aims to enable more smart home devices to speak to each other.  Google pushes deep into hardware with new Wifi, Chromecast, Home, and Pixel smartphone devices at a press event in San Francisco, California on October 4, 2016. [Photo: AFP]  The goal of the plan would be to allow developers to build new products without paying royalties for connectivity software, and enabling consumers to then choose their preferred voice assistants on the devices.  The project ""aims to improve the consumer experience of trying to use smart home products that aren't compatible with each other,"" according to a statement by the new working group.  ""We believe that the protocol has the potential to be widely adopted across home systems and assistants such as Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, and others.""  The new project also includes the Zigbee Alliance, a separate effort to develop a common wireless standard for connected devices that includes manufacturers such as Samsung, retailers such as Ikea and other tech firms, including Texas Instruments and NXP Semiconductors.  ""The industry working group will take an open-source approach for the development and implementation of a new, unified connectivity protocol,"" the statement said.  ""The project intends to use contributions from market-tested smart home technologies from Amazon, Apple, Google, Zigbee Alliance, and others.""  The worldwide market for smart home devices is expected to reach nearly 815 million devices this year, up 23 percent from 2018, according to the research firm IDC, and 1.39 billion by 2023.  - Helping developers -  The initiative called ""Project Connected Home over IP"" could promote more smart home products, making it easier for developers of products ranging from smart refrigerators to voice-activated lightbulbs, who are now forced to choose among various standards.  ""Developers and consumers will benefit from this new universal smart home connectivity standard,"" engineers Nik Sathe and Grant Erickson of Google Nest, the connected home division of the tech giant, said in a statement.  ""For developers, it simplifies product development and reduces costs by giving them one standard for building their products. You will then have the power to choose how you want to control your homes, independent of which smart home technology you choose.""  They added that new smart home devices using this standard will be compatible with various platforms from Google, Amazon, Apple and others.  The move comes weeks ahead of the opening of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where tech firms will be showcasing thousands of smart home devices ranging from connected lightbulbs to toilets.  Analysts have said the market for these ""internet of things"" devices has been held back in part by the confusing array of different standards from the various manufacturers.  Avi Greengart of the consultancy Techsponential said the joint effort is a positive step but that it remains unclear if this can gain traction among the many makers of connected devices.  ""I'm hopeful because this is a good idea but I'm skeptical because good ideas don't always have an impact in the market,"" Greengart said.  The current market ""is really fragmented so getting some of the biggest names in consumer IoT and home automation is a step in the right direction but execution is key,"" Greengart added.  The analysts said the inclusion of Apple suggests the new standards could include improved privacy standards for the various devices which may be used for sensitive applications such as home security or baby monitoring.  ""If Apple is backing this it's likely it can be implemented in a secure way,"" he said. ""Security and privacy are top of mind for these companies."""

网站,"Apple Offers Discount On Apple Arcade, But There's A Catch","KEY POINTSApple is now offering a new subscription option to Apple ArcadeThe annual subscription option allows Apple Arcade users to save as much as $10 compared to monthly subscriptionYearly subscription to Apple Arcade only costs $49.99 while monthly subscription costs $5  The Cupertino tech juggernaut this week launched a new annual subscription alternative in Apple Arcade, the company's video game streaming service. The latest offering includes unlimited access to an extensive and growing library of premium mobile games, but you have to subscribe for 12 months to avail of the discounted price.   The new annual subscription of Apple Arcade costs $49.99, which saves subscribers around $10 if they opt to subscribe to the video game streaming service every month. To access the new subscription offer, simply go to the Account tab in the iOS App Store, tap in the upper right-hand corner, and tap Subscriptions.   Following its official unveiling last March, Apple Arcade was released in September with more or less 100 titles, and more games being added in its library each month. So far, the Cupertino tech giant's game streaming service has received positive reviews partially due to the ads, the in-app purchase model, and the low subscription cost of $5 every month. These strategies further reinforce Apple's already strong value proposition.   Apple Arcade could bring more consumers to online games with its low monthly price for unlimited play  Photo: GETTY IMAGES / Michael Short  It took the Cupertino tech giant almost a couple of years before it introduced a yearly subscription for Apple Music, which was initially launched in June 2015. The service discount the Apple Arcade offers aright now is similar to that of Apple Music that costs $99 for compared to the monthly subscription of $10. Apple Music service is fundamentally more complicated since the company must contend with record labels that have licensing rights.  In the case of Apple Arcade, the company is assisting in the funding of some of the game developments and has far greater control over the terms of service. Apple TV+, which is the video streaming service of the Cupertino tech giant, was launched last month and also included a yearly subscription at the same price point as Apple Arcade, which is $50 a year. At present, Apple is giving away a free year of Apple TV+ subscription with hardware purchases.  Apple is getting more aggressive in offering its services, such as the Apple Arcade, Apple Music, and Apple TV+. Reports claim that this is the company's strategy to compensate for the drop in iPhone sales for this year."

网站,Today in Apple history: Apple crushes Think Secret rumors site,"Today in Apple history: Apple crushes Think Secret rumors site  By Luke Dormehl • 5:00 am, December 19, 2019  Cupertino's battle with a rumor site splits Apple fans.   Image: Ste Smith/Cult of Mac  December 19, 2007:  Apple settles a lawsuit with reporter Nick Ciarelli, resulting in the shuttering of Think Secret, his masssively popular Apple rumors website.  Writing under the screen name Nick de Plume, Harvard student Ciarelli had broken a number of Apple stories on the site, which he launched in the late 1990s.  The terms of Ciarelli’s settlement with Apple remain secret. In a statement, he says he will “be able to move forward with my college studies and broader journalistic pursuits.”  Apple drops the hammer on Think SecretAnyone who followed Apple news in the early 2000s probably read Think Secret. Although Ciarelli never revealed the source of his scoops, someone deeply entrenched at Apple (at least at one time) fed him a steady stream of accurate (or mostly accurate) reports about upcoming products.  These included unofficial screenshots of Mac OS X Leopard before Apple released the operating system. The straw that apparently broke the camel’s back, however, was a series of reports about an upcoming Macintosh and word processing software.  Think Secret reported these rumors in 2004. They were shown to be true when Steve Jobs debuted the Mac mini and iWork productivity suite at the January 2005 Macworld event in San Francisco.  Apple: The evil empire?  When Apple sued Think Secret for revealing trade secrets, opinion among Apple followers diverged wildly. Some saw the lawsuit as a violation of Apple’s generally friendly approach to cultivating fans. In short, as Apple climbed back to the top of the tech world, the company used its resources to crack down on a small-time journalist. (Steve Wozniak became the biggest name to ask Apple to call off the attack dogs.)  On a larger level, some viewed the lawsuit as proof that Apple opposed freedom of the press. These people worried that clamping down on the rumor mill would result in a sanitized world of Apple news. In this view, the only inside knowledge would come, either directly or indirectly, through Apple-sanctioned channels.  Others sided with Apple, arguing that the First Amendment does not protect publication of trade secrets. For those of this mindset, it made sense for Apple to go after employees who shared proprietary information with outsiders.  Apple’s war on rumors and Think SecretStopping such leaks of confidential information appears to have been Apple’s biggest goal in its war against bloggers at the time. The company took similar legal action against Apple Insider and O’Grady’s Powerpage.  Steve Jobs brought secrecy back to Cupertino when he returned to Apple in 1997. This triggered a big culture shock inside the company. During the early 1990s, Apple had been one of the more leak-heavy companies in Silicon Valley.  Think Secret publisher Ciarelli never shared details on the fallout from his legal battle with Apple. However, he claimed to be an Apple fan before and after the suit finished. According to LinkedIn, he currently works for BookBub, a company he co-founded in 2012. BookBub alerts readers to limited-time free and discounted ebooks matching their interests.

网站,"Apple 2020 preview: iPhone 12, Apple Watch 6 and a lot more","Predicting what Apple will do is a tricky business. The company is famously secretive, though leaks from far corners of its supply chain can give us some clues, particularly when it comes to new iPhones. Still, for a company with a reputation for being groundbreaking, Apple is remarkably conservative. Most of its product lines will continue to zig along, remaining on their existing trajectories, with some minor updates or course corrections.  But when Apple zags, it can be an enormous surprise ? and often a defining moment for the tech world at large. Here's a look at the crystal ball for Apple in 2020, forecasting where the company's business is bubbling along and where there might be an opportunity for big moves.  iPhone 12 and iPhone SE 2: More is moreWhen Apple zags, it can be an enormous surprise.  The story of the iPhone of 2019 was a redefinition and repricing of the base-model product. Yes, the iPhone 11 is just the successor to 2018's iPhone XR, but by giving the 11 the flagship name and cutting the price, Apple sent a strong signal that the iPhone product line was going to be more accessible and affordable than in previous years.  Expect more of that in 2020, as rumors suggest that Apple will launch the iPhone SE 2, this time as a lower-cost phone at the size of the iPhone 6, 7 and 8. Rumors also suggest that the company will add a smaller, lower-cost companion to the iPhone 11.  We can also expect the iPhone 12, which should bring 5G connectivity to Apple's lineup. Besides a 5G modem, the iPhone 12 lineup could add features like a new time-of-flight sensor that delivers more augmented-reality features, a screen with a faster refresh rate and the usual performance improvements from a new Apple-designed processor. Throw the iPhone 12 models into the mix, and the result would be five brand-new phone models released in a single calendar year, which would be a record for Apple.  Renders show off what the iPhone 12 could look like.   (Image credit: PhoneArena)It's not a bad way to counter stagnant iPhone sales: Offer high-end, high-feature products for Apple's most demanding and price-insensitive customer base, while making the lower-end models that don't feel like a bunch of day-old doughnuts. Still, it's worth noting that this will mark the fourth year of the design introduced with the iPhone X and the third year of the iPhone XR/11 design. If Apple doesn't change things up, it risks another sales slide as a market eager for a truly new iPhone gets more of the same old, same old.  iOS 14 and Apple software: Sleek stability Whether by plan or by accident, Apple finds itself in a tick-tock cycle of software development. After a chaotic and controversial 2017, Apple responded in 2018 by rolling out new versions of macOS and iOS that were focused on stability and performance, and it executed well on that focus. But this year, Apple's operating systems took large strides forward and ended up getting bitten by bugs. A summer that Apple developers might have spent building Mac apps based on iOS code or learning how to build apps using the new SwiftUI framework was instead spent dealing with bugs and compatibility updates.  Look for the pendulum to shift back in 2020, with Apple taking its foot off the gas a bit and instead providing an island of stability for developers and users alike. This isn't to say that Apple won't offer new features to iOS, macOS, iPadOS, watchOS and tvOS in 2020; rather, the company will feel less fear about kicking some features out into 2021 to make sure that this year's summer of instability isn't repeated. It's a shift in gears that will also give SwiftUI and Mac Catalyst another cycle to mature.  Apple CEO Tim Cook at the iPhone 11 launch (Image credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)  As for iOS 14 specifically, beyond stability, I imagine that 2020's iOS update will lean even further into augmented reality and improvements to machine learning. Apple will continue to develop the software that will make or break the company's future wearable products as ancillary features for the iPad and iPhone. Traditionally, Apple has added new iPad features only every other year, but with the debut of the iPadOS name in 2019, the company has put itself on the spot. So presumably we'll see some new iPad features as well, perhaps focused on further bringing the iPad up to parity with traditional PC features, by improving multitasking, for example.  More MacBooks get Magic Keyboard and an ARM-based MacBook Air?I do wonder if Apple's surprise move of the year might come on the Mac side.  With the introduction of the 16-inch MacBook Pro in November, it seems like Apple is embarking on a transition that will bring a much-wanted keyboard redesign to all the company's laptops throughout 2020. At the very least, expect a new 13- or 14-inch MacBook Pro in the spring, with a Magic Keyboard and a reduced Touch Bar with a real Escape key. It's hard to believe that the company won't also update the MacBook Air, introduced a year ago, with a much less controversial keyboard.  I do wonder if Apple's surprise move of the year might come on the Mac side. For years now, there's been speculation that Apple would move away from using Intel processors on the Mac in favor of Apple-designed, ARM-based chips like those found in the iPad and iPhone. This hasn't happened yet, but the consumer side of Apple's laptop line consists of just the Retina MacBook Air. I wouldn't be surprised if Apple finally took the wraps off a new processor family for the Mac in 2020, starting with a power-sipping consumer laptop with a long-lasting battery. (Then again, I predicted this in 2019 and it didn't happen. One of these days ... )  Apple last updated the iMac Pro two years ago and the iMac in the spring of 2019. The iMac remains a billion-dollar business for Apple, but the product hasn't seen a major redesign in years. Perhaps this is the year that Apple takes the reengineering that it used to create the iMac Pro and rolls that out into at least the larger 5K iMac model. At the very least, though, it's time for the company to update the iMac Pro, which is a better value than the just-launched Mac Pro if you don't need the expansion capabilities.  Stay the course with the iPadA few years ago, Apple watchers were abuzz about the apparent belly-flop taken by the iPad, which started out so strong and then saw sales drop over nearly five years. You don't see so much hand-wringing about the iPad these days, because Apple has completely revamped the product line and seen sales success across the price spectrum.  Apple goes into 2020 with an iPad mini, a low-cost iPad, a midrange iPad Air and high-end iPad Pro models. It's hard to imagine that Apple will do much more in 2020 than refresh the current iPad line where necessary and allow the iPad to keep motoring along.  Apple Watch 6 and AirPods 2I fully expect two of Apple's biggest categories for product growth to continue their run in 2020. I don't expect Apple to add any augmented-reality products to its portfolio in 2020, but the company's success with AirPods and the Apple Watch suggests that Apple knows there's a lot of money to be made in convincing consumers to wear new technology accessories.  The Apple Watch Series 5 introduced an always-on display. Could sleep tracking features be next?   (Image credit: Tom's Guide)It's hard to imagine that Apple will actually update the AirPods in 2020, after two product releases in 2019, though there's a persistent rumor that an over-the-ear headphone version of AirPods branded as Apple products rather than Beats may be in the offing. Meanwhile, after the company went to an always-on display with the Apple Watch Series 5 in 2019, I'd imagine the next frontier for Apple's health-minded wearable will be sleep tracking, which will require extended battery life.  Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade and other servicesApple's revenue story for services continues to grow. While the company launched numerous services ? including Apple TV Plus, Apple News Plus and Apple Arcade ? in 2019, the company needs to tweak those services in 2020 and set them up for future growth. That's especially true for Apple TV Plus, which will need to convince millions of users who got the first year free not to cancel their subscriptions when the freebie dries up.  Apple Arcade could see some changes in 2020.   (Image credit: Tom's Guide)In fact, this is the area where I expect the most surprises out of Apple. I don't think the company's done expanding its service offerings, whether that means revamping News Plus or making major acquisitions for Apple Arcade. It'll certainly keep spending billions on content by buying major TV and film players. There are rumblings that the company is getting into creating original podcast content, as well.  Big acquisitions?I wouldn't put it past Apple to make some major (dare I say surprising?) acquisitions on the services side. The company has the money to buy existing businesses with large portfolios of programming and intellectual property, whether that's ViacomCBS or Sony or Lionsgate or some other smaller entertainment company. And don't sleep on Apple acquiring or cutting a major deal with an independent movie studio as well in order to keep feeding the relentless appetite of the Apple streaming service."
网站,Apple Authorised Service Provider: alles over erkende Apple serviceproviders (AASP),"Als je problemen hebt met je Mac, iPhone of een ander product kun je natuurlijk contact met Apple opnemen. Maar je kunt ook terecht bij een Apple Authorised Service Provider. Op deze pagina vertellen we je er alles over en ontdek je wat de verschillen zijn met de Genius Bar in de Apple Store.  Apple Authorised Service Provider: wat is het?Een Erkende Apple serviceprovider is een bedrijf dat reparaties en andere diensten aanbiedt aan Apple-gebruikers. Er zijn twee soorten serviceproviders:  Erkende serviceproviders: bedrijven die toestemming hebben om reparaties aan te bieden aan alle  Apple-klanten.Beperkte serviceproviders: dit zijn bedrijven en instellingen die werken met een beperkte serviceovereenkomst. Zij mogen service aanbieden voor specifieke Apple-producten of aan bepaalde klanten. Dit is vastgelegd in de overeenkomst.  Bedrijven moeten dus goedgekeurd zijn om zich erkende of beperkte serviceprovider te mogen noemen. Het gaat hierbij vooral om professioneel georganiseerde reparatiebedrijven. Maar een universiteit of hogeschool die zelf reparaties aan studenten aanbiedt, zou zich ook kunnen aanmelden. Alle reparaties moeten worden uitgevoerd door gecertificeerde Apple-technici. Medewerkers zullen daarom de voorgeschreven cursussen moeten volgen en over de nodige diploma’s moeten beschikken.  Erkende Apple serviceproviders in NederlandDit zijn enkele voorbeelden van erkende Apple serviceproviders:  Microfix, o.a. in Amsterdam en LeidenCard Services, o.a. in Utrecht en ZwolleAMac, met vestigingen in heel Nederlandivizi, met vestigingen in Limburg  Je kunt de dichtstbijzijnde Erkende Apple serviceprovider vinden op deze pagina. Je moet eerst een product kiezen waarmee je problemen hebt en krijgt daarna een kaartje te zien met beschikbare locaties. Soms kun je meteen een afspraak inboeken, zoals op de afbeelding hieronder te zien is:  Waarom een Apple Authorised Service Provider bezoeken?Als je je kapotte Apple-product laat repareren door een Apple Authorised Service Provider weet je dat je dezelfde kwaliteit krijgt als bij de Genius Bar. Bovendien kunnen alleen erkende serviceproviders rechtstreeks bij Apple onderdelen bestellen voor het uitvoeren van reparaties. Je weet dus zeker dat de reparaties met originele onderdelen worden uitgevoerd. De prijzen die de AASP’s hanteren liggen op hetzelfde niveau als bij Apple.  Als Apple terughaalacties en reparatieprogramma’s voor defecte producten organiseert kun je daarvoor vaak ook terecht bij de Apple Authorised Service Providers, zodat je niet helemaal naar een Apple Store hoeft te reizen. De iPhone-reparaties die door een AASP worden gedaan worden door Apple gezien als van dezelfde kwaliteit als in de Apple Store.  Je kunt reparaties ook laten uitvoeren door een niet-erkend reparatiebedrijf en bent dan vaak wat goedkoper uit. Je loopt dan echter wel het risico dat er met niet-officiГ«le onderdelen wordt gewerkt. Mocht je later problemen krijgen met je toestel en met je toestel terug naar Apple’s Genius Bar moeten, dan wordt er wat soepeler omgesprongen met vervangen onderdelen als dit door een erkende serviceprovider is gedaan.  Eisen aan Apple Authorised Service ProviderAlleen resellers, servicebedrijven en onderwijsinstellingen kunnen zich aanmelden om erkende Apple serviceprovider te worden. Individuele personen of handelaars komen niet in aanmerking. Na goedkeuring krijg je vergoeding voor arbeid en onderdelen om de reparaties uit te voeren.

网站,Today in Apple history: Apple brings back Steve Jobs with NeXT buyout,"Today in Apple history: Apple brings back Steve Jobs with NeXT buyout  By Luke Dormehl • 5:00 am, December 20, 2019  Steve Jobs pictured on December 20, 1996.   Photo: Tim Holmes/Flickr CC   December 20, 1996:  Apple Computer buys NeXT, the computer company Steve Jobs founded after leaving Cupertino a decade earlier.  The deal costs Apple $429 million. It’s a massive price to pay for the failing NeXT, which already saw its hardware division crash and burn. The price is worth it when you consider what Apple gets as part of the deal, however: the return of Steve Jobs.  Return of the kingThe Apple co-founder didn’t just come as part of the NeXT package. He was a major part of the deal. “I’m not just buying software, I’m buying Steve,” Apple CEO Gil Amelio said at the time. As part of the deal, Jobs got 1.5 million shares of Apple stock.  Apple’s QuickTake camera, used to take this picture of Steve Jobs and Gil Amelio, did a poor job reproducing color. The purple jackets were actually black.   Photo: Tim Holmes/Flickr CCJobs wasn’t initially intended to be Apple’s new CEO.  Bizarrely, Amelio apparently thought Jobs could be contained as a creative force. Amelio figured he could continue running the company, and simply wheel out Jobs whenever Apple needed him.  Less than a year later, Amelio exited and Jobs became Apple’s new CEO.  Interestingly, one of the holdups in the Apple/NeXT deal was that Jobs didn’t want to commit to Cupertino for a set period of time. The argument came down to his leadership of Pixar, the animation studio that turned him into a billionaire just a year earlier.  This crucial part of the deal meant delaying an announcement that most reporters knew was coming. In the end, as everyone knows, Jobs wound up working at Apple until the very end of his life. However, he managed to win the argument by agreeing to act as an “informal adviser” at Apple, with no contract.  Steve Jobs’ triumphant return to AppleIn retrospect, Jobs’ return to Apple was the start of one of the greatest third-act comebacks in business history. At the time, the success was anything but guaranteed. Apple was hemorrhaging money and headed for bankruptcy.  In 1992, Apple stock hit $60 a share. At the time of Jobs’ return, AAPL had fallen to $17. To highlight just how poorly this reflected on Apple, bear in mind that this was during the tech bubble. Silicon Valley companies routinely saw their share prices double or triple, often without any justification in their earnings reports.  Still, Jobs had faith that he could undo some of the terrible decisions Apple had made (such as the horrendous “clone Mac” deal). But to the outside world, he was a visionary who had failed with NeXT. And, had Toy Story not transformed Pixar’s fortunes, he could have failed with that company as well.  Still, any reason to be cheerful about Apple was good in 1996 — and the nostalgic return of its exiled co-founder was good enough.  OpenStep: The NeXT step for Apple softwareJobs wasn’t the only thing Apple got from the NeXT deal. Yes, that drove up the price of the company at the time. But Apple also acqui-hired some impressive employees who became crucial to the company over the coming years.  The one still in Cupertino today (although he left for a 10-year period from 1999 to 2009) is Craig Federighi, currently Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering.  Significantly, Apple also got NeXT’s NeXTSTEP operating system, then called OpenStep. Since NeXT had ceased making its own hardware, the company no longer needed a proprietary OS.  This was another chief driver in the deal, since Apple was desperate for a new operating system after the failure of its Copland project. (That supposedly next-gen OS never got any further out the door at 1 Infinite Loop than a beta version released to around 50 Mac developers a year earlier.)  OpenStep was an object-oriented, multitasking operating system based on Unix, which later became the basis for OS X and, subsequently, macOS. The importance of this part of the deal did not become evident until a few years later, when Apple released its new operating system as Mac OS X Server 1.0 in 1999. The consumer version, Mac OS X, followed in 2001.  Do you remember Jobs’ return to Apple? Leave your comments below.  Sign up for our free Apple history email"

网站,Today in Apple history: Apple invents ‘slide to unlock’,"Today in Apple history: Apple invents ‘slide to unlock’  By Luke Dormehl • 5:00 am, December 23, 2019  ""Slide to unlock"" drew audible gasps from the audience when Steve Jobs first showed it off.   Photo: Jared Earle/Flickr CC  December 23, 2005: Apple files a patent application for its iconic “slide to unlock” gesture for the iPhone.  At this point, the iPhone remained a secret research project. However, the ability to unlock the device by sliding your finger across it signifies Apple’s big ambitions for its smartphone. Cupertino wants the iPhone to be easy to use, intuitive and miles ahead of the competition technologically.  ‘Slide to unlock’ sums up the iPhone philosophyGiven everything the iPhone can do, it sounds silly to say that “slide to unlock” made a gigantic impression on me when I first saw it. But it did.  Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, as cellphones became ubiquitous, a surprisingly large amount of time and money went into coming up with an elegant solution for unlocking phones. These patents bore unwieldy titles like “Apparatus and method for preventing inadvertent operation of a manual input device.” But they all referred to the same thing: how to stop the dreaded “butt dial.”  Great things start with simple sketches.   Photo: USPTO  Most smartphone manufacturers got around the unlocking problem by implementing specific sets of button presses. Users were unlikely to enter these combinations by accident and trigger an unintended call. But the iPhone, of course, came with just a single button on its main display: the Home button. With “slide to unlock,” Apple came up with a method that immediately conveyed the simplicity, elegance and superior touch-recognition technology the company wanted to demonstrate with the iPhone.  As with the best graphical user interface elements, “slide to unlock” served as a metaphor for a real-life action. The gesture mimicked dragging a bolt back across a door to unlock it. The sensitivity of the movement, and the way the bolt would immediately snap back to its starting position if you failed to carry out the gesture correctly, gave it the kind of “fiddle factor” that former Apple design chief Jony Ive always liked.  99 problems, but iPhone slide to unlock ain’t is oneWith iOS 10, Apple finally consigned the iconic “slide to unlock” gesture to the digital scrap heap. A feature that drew gasps of amazement when Apple introduced the original iPhone in 2007 found its days numbered when Apple introduced Touch ID biometric authentication with the iPhone 5s in 2013. Apple followed that with Face ID’s facial-recognition system in 2017.  Nonetheless, the “slide to unlock” patent surfaced in the long-running Samsung-Apple lawsuit, which concluded in 2018.

网站,"Apple Store and AppleCare Employees will Get Free Apple Arcade, TV+, Music Services","Being an Apple employee has its own perks. An internal bulletin from Apple says that Apple Store and AppleCare support employees from levels S1-S5 will receive free access to Apple Arcade, Music and Apple TV+ starting from January 6th.  We are not sure how the free subscription will help Apple employees. Perhaps it will help them get acquainted with the services and become capable of handling queries. This is not the first time Apple is offering perks for employees, earlier it had doled out discounts on Apple Watch a few years ago. Furthermore, Apple has already placed huge advertising campaigns for Apple Arcade and has preloaded select titles on demo devices.  That being said, employees will be able to get Apple Arcade, Apple TV+ free only for themselves and have to pay for family sharing. Furthermore, Apple Store employees will also be getting $100 off on Apple Watch purchases and the offer is valid from January to March.  Our TakeApple is not only making employees happy by offering free services, but also encouraging them to use the services. Typically, one needs to use a product/service to be in a position to help customers. Apple’s idea of giving away free subscriptions will help employees get acquainted with Apple Arcade, TV+ and Apple Music ecosystem.  It is no secret that Apple is aggressively pushing its services. With the addition of Apple Arcade and TV+, the company is likely to gear towards better revenue. It will be interesting to see if Apple’s revenue from services will exceed that of selling hardware in the near future.  .adslot_1 { width: 300px; height: 250px; } @media (min-width:340px) { .adslot_1 { width: 336px; height: 280px; } } Like this post?

网站,AppleCare and store employees get free Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade beginning 2020,"Apple will be handing out free Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade services for employees within levels S1 to S5. The Apple perk is largely limited only to employee use- if they want their family in on the subscription they’d have to pay for Family Sharing features.  It’s unclear whether the free Apple TV+ or Arcade will be a perk for all Apple employees around the world. In Apple’s point of view, employees can gain a deeper understanding of Apple Arcade and Apple TV+’s features which can prove to be helpful in day-to-day interaction with store customers.  Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade are both subscription services that cost $4.99 a month. Those who want to try it out can play Arcade free for a month and watch Apple TV+ for 7 days. New iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac and iPod Touch owners can get the free 12-month Apple TV+ promo."
网站,Apple in Talks With MGM and Pac-12 Over Content Deals for Apple TV+,"Apple is working to bolster its Apple TV+ offerings and has been exploring deals for MGM Holdings content and college sports rights, reports   The Wall Street Journal.   Apple executives met with MGM representatives and the Pac-12 Conference this year for preliminary talks that have “yet to reach an advanced stage.” Inking a Pac-12 deal would give Apple its first live sports content, allowing the company to better compete with other streaming video services. MGM, meanwhile, has a huge catalog of content, though it’s not known if a deal with Apple would focus on new, original content or would include existing content offerings.   According to The Wall Street Journal, Apple’s meeting with MGM and Pac-12 suggest that Apple is open to major content deals to improve its ‌Apple TV‌+ service, which means that in the future, third-party content could be added to ‌Apple TV‌+ alongside Apple’s own original content.   At the current time, ‌Apple TV‌+ features just a handful of Apple’s original TV shows, such as “The Morning Show,” “For All Mankind,” “Servant,” and “See.” Some of the shows have received praise and have been nominated for awards, but Apple’s content offerings cannot compete with the large catalogs available on Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+.   Apple is charging $4.99 per month for ‌Apple TV‌+, and while many subscribers have a free year after purchasing an Apple device, Apple will need to make ‌Apple TV‌+ worth the subscription fee in the future. It’s not clear if consumers will want to pay a $4.99 per month fee for limited content."

网站,Apple Likely to Add James Bond & College Sports to Apple TV+,"Apple  (AAPL - Free Report) has been mulling to add James Bond movie and live sports to strengthen the content portfolio of its Apple TV+ streaming service.  Per a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, executives of the iPhone-maker have met representatives of MGM Holdings and Pac-12 Conference, this year.  While MGM Holdings is the co-owner of the James Bond movie franchise, Pac-12 Conference is a leader in college sports and comprises 12 of the most prestigious universities in the world.  However, Apple?s discussions with both parties are in the preliminary stage.  Apple TV+ Focuses on Original Productions   Notably, Apple TV+ was launched on Nov 1 with a number of original productions, including The Morning Show, See, For All Mankind, Dickinson, Helpsters, Snoopy in Space, Ghostwriter and documentary film The Elephant Queen.  Other significant offerings included Oprah?s Book Club, featuring Oprah Winfrey. New originals that were subsequently launched were Servant (Nov 28) and Truth Be Told (Dec 6).  Further, Hala starring Geraldine Viswanathan started streaming on Apple TV+ following a limited theatrical release on Nov 22.  However, Apple delayed the release of its much-anticipated movie, The Banker, following a controversy, per Variety.  Meanwhile, Apple released the trailer for its upcoming comedy anthology series Little America, set to premiere on Jan 17, 2020. Another new comedy series Mythic Quest: Raven?s Banquet, co-created by It?s Always Sunny in Philadelphia?s Rob McElhenney and Charlie Day, is set to release on Feb 7.  Other shows set to be released in 2020 on Apple TV+ includes Visible: Out on Television and Little Voice.  MGM?s Solid Portfolio to Aid Apple TV+   Although Apple has an enviable content of shows and series, lack of a blockbuster movie franchise is a headwind for the company due to significant competition in the streaming space, which is currently dominated by Netflix (NFLX - Free Report) . Disney?s (DIS - Free Report) entry with Disney+ and Comcast?s (CMCSA - Free Report) upcoming Peacock service are expected to intensify competition further.  Hence, a deal with MGM will rapidly expand Apple TV+?s movie content. Apart from the James Bond franchise, the privately-held MGM has several well-known movies like Hobbit, RoboCop, The Silence of the Lambs, The Magnificent Seven and Four Weddings and a Funeral in its portfolio.  Similarly, a deal with Pac 12 and its cable network will help Apple enter the college sports live streaming, a space currently dominated by major television networks ? ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC ? as well as cable television providers like ESPN, FS1, Fox?s cable sports channel, NBC Sports and CBS Sports cable channels.  Apple currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

网站,Is the Apple Card worth the hype?,"Loyal Apple consumers may wonder if the Apple Card lives up to the hype and whether the no-fee card is truly the best choice for Apple purchases.  Below, CNBC Select breaks down all you need to know about the Apple Card ” from the cash-back program to fees, payments, fine print, privacy and security.  Who's this for?  The Apple Card has generated a lot of buzz with its unique ""Daily Cash"" program and quirks of its titanium card. The card was created with the dedicated iPhone user in mind and has a cash-back program tailored to fans of Apple products and services.  You'll earn the most cash back (3%) on goods or services purchased directly from Apple (including Apple retail stores, the Apple online store, the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music and other Apple-owned properties), Walgreens and Duane Reade stores, on the Walgreens app and on walgreens.com, on Uber and UberEats, in T-Mobile stores and at Nike. All purchases made with Apple Pay earn 2% cash back, and you earn 1% cash back when paying with the physical Apple Card.  *To calculate the rewards you could earn using your Apple Pay card, we assumed that cardholders will use Apple Pay for 70% of their purchases at a rate of 2% cash back, since 70% of all merchants accept Apple Pay, according to an Apple spokesperson. We also assumed the cardholder would use the physical Apple Card for the other 30% of their purchases at a rate of 1% cash back. You may earn a higher or lower return depending on your spending habits.  Apple refers to cash back as ""Daily Cash,"" and cardholders can earn it at a rate of 3% cash back on goods or services purchased directly from Apple (including Apple retail stores, the Apple online store, the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music and other Apple-owned properties) on Uber and UberEats, at Walgreens and Duane Reade stores, on the Walgreens app and on walgreens.com, in T-Mobile stores and at Nike, 2% cash back on Apple Pay purchases and 1% cash back on all other purchases. There is no welcome bonus for this card.  The cash-back program is competitive, but it isn't the highest earning on Apple purchases. The U.S. Bank Cash+ „¢ Visa Signature ® Card offers 5% cash back in two categories of your choosing, on up to $2,000 in combined purchases a quarter. According to a U.S. Bank spokesperson, the card's ""electronics stores"" category includes Apple Store in-store and online purchases while the ""TV, internet and streaming services"" category includes most purchases made through the App Store, Apple Music and iTunes.  Daily Cash automatically deposited into your Apple Cash card (located in the Wallet app) at the end of every night, once the transaction is posted to your account. Any transaction that is still pending won't post at the end of the next day.  Daily Cash can be used in a number of ways: applied as a statement credit to your Apple Card balance, spent like cash through Apple Pay, transferred to a bank account or sent to friends via iMessage. Unlike some rewards cards, the value of Daily Cash is the same, no matter how you redeem it.  If you don't have an active Apple Cash card, your cash back accrues in your Apple Card account, and you can manually redeem it through the Wallet app.  The Apple Card is one of the few cards on the market that has no fees whatsoever. There are no annual fees, no foreign transaction fees and no late payment fees.  That said, you can still incur interest charges if you don't pay your bill in full every month. The current variable APR is 12.99% to 23.99% based on your creditworthiness, which is pretty similar to other cards.  Unfortunately, this card doesn't offer any interest-free financing options, so if you use it to pay for big ticket purchases, such as a new iPhone 11, you'll want to pay the balance in full so you don't incur interest.  If you want to pay off new purchases over time, consider the Chase Freedom Unlimited ®, which offers a 0% APR for the first 15 months from account opening (then a 16.49% to 25.24% variable APR).  All payments toward your Apple Card balance are done through the Wallet app. There is no online site or separate app. The Apple Card has user-friendly financial wellness tools that show users exactly how much it will cost if they carry a balance, so you know the consequences of not paying in full.  When you navigate to payments in the Wallet app, there's a simulation wheel with a ""payment nudge"" that allows you to select a payment amount and see how much interest you'd be charged for the given payment. You can adjust the ""nudge"" by sliding it with your finger to see what the interest would be if you only paid the minimum due, one third of your balance or any other amount.  When you want to make a payment, you can schedule it for a future date or immediately. Link an external bank account or use the money in your Apple Cash account to pay your bill.  To view a detailed snapshot of your spending history in real-time, Apple categorizes purchases by color so you can track your spending weekly or monthly. You can also see where and when you made the purchases, plus the transaction cost.  Apple is known for keeping consumers' data private, and the company continues that mission with Apple Card through advanced security measures that protect cardholders' privacy. Each transaction made with the digital Apple Card requires your device number and a one ‘time, dynamic security code, which is authorized via Face ID, Touch ID or passcode.  Purchases made with the physical card are secured with chip technology. Plus the physical card has no numbers on it ” no card number, security code or expiration date ” which makes it practically impossible for someone to steal your information when you hand your card to pay.  While the physical Apple Card has no card number, that doesn't prevent you from completing online transactions. If an online merchant doesn't support Apple Pay, and you need to enter your card number to complete a purchase, simply access that information through the Wallet app. After clicking on your Apple Card, select the three dots on the top right and navigate to ""Card Information,"" which will display your card number, expiration and security code.  Similar to other cards, if you misplace your card, you have the option to freeze it and request a replacement ” which can be done directly from the Wallet app.  If you're concerned about which parties can view your transaction data, rest assured Apple states it won't look at your transaction data, though Goldman Sachs does have access to it for operational purposes, such as reviewing transactions for fraudulent activity. However, Goldman Sachs will never share or sell your data to third parties.  According to the Apple Card's cardmember agreement, if you modify or ""jailbreak"" your iPhone, you may no longer be eligible to access or manage your Apple Card.  The Apple Card is a great choice for loyal fans of the brand who are looking for a card that seamlessly integrates with the Wallet app. If you want to earn competitive rewards on Apple, Walgreens, T-Mobile Uber and UberEats purchases, this card can earn you unlimited 3% cash back.  This card has a leg up on many other rewards cards with its unique Daily Cash program, which is perfect for consumers looking for the flexibility to redeem rewards within a few days of earning them. Plus the entirely no-fee structure and user-friendly payment tools are a great way to save cardholders money and encourage payments to be made in full.  However, if you lack an iPhone or want a card with an introductory 0% APR period, you should check out alternative rewards credit cards or balance transfer cards. Also note that while Apple Pay is accepted at 70% of merchants, according to a company spokesperson, you may run into trouble using it everywhere. Therefore, it may be a good idea to also carry a flat-rate cash-back card that offers more than 1% cash back on everyday purchases.  The Alliant Cashback Visa ® Signature Credit Card (3% unlimited cash back on all purchases during the first year; 2.5% on all purchases after) or Citi ® Double Cash Card (2% on every purchase with unlimited 1% cash back when you buy, plus an additional 1% as you pay for those purchases) are our top two alternatives.  Information about the Alliant Cashback Visa ® Signature Card and U.S. Bank Cash+ „¢ Visa Signature ® Card has been collected independently by CNBC and has not been reviewed or provided by the issuer of the cards prior to publication."
网站,Apple Officially Launches Public Bug Bounty Program Covering All Apple Software,"Apple today officially opened its bug bounty program to all security researchers, after the company announced the expansion plan at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas earlier this year.   Prior to now, Apple’s bug bounty program was invitation-based and non-iOS devices were not included. As reported by ZDNet, from today any security researcher who locates bugs in iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, or iCloud will be eligible to receive a cash payout for disclosing the vulnerability to Apple.   Apple has also increased the maximum size of the bounty from $200,000 per exploit to $1 million depending on the nature of the security flaw. A zero-click kernel code execution with persistence will earn the maximum amount.   Apple says it will add a 50 percent bonus on top of the standard payout for bugs found in beta software, which allows the company to nix the issue before the OS version goes public. It is also offering the same bonus for so-called “regression bugs” – these are bugs that Apple has patched in the past but which have been accidentally reintroduced in a later version of the software.   Apple has published more information on its website detailing the bug bounty program’s rules, as well as a full breakdown of the rewards being offered to researchers based on the exploits they uncover.   When submitting reports, researchers must include a detailed description of the issue, an explanation of the state of the system when the exploit works, and enough information for Apple to reliably reproduce the issue.   Next year, Apple plans to provide vetted and trusted security researchers and hackers with “dev” iPhones, or special iPhones that provide deeper access to the underlying software and operating system that will make it easier for vulnerabilities to be discovered.
