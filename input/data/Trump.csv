网站,"Trump defends Kavanaugh, again","US President Donald Trump mounted an angry defense of Supreme Court ­Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Sunday as the controversial judge faced calls for an investigation, or even impeachment, over fresh allegations of sexual misconduct.Trump blasted the media and ""Radical Left Democrats"" after a former Yale classmate of Kavanaugh alleged that the jurist - one of the most senior judges in the land - exposed himself at a freshman year party.The latest allegation in The New York Times came after Kavanaugh denied sexual misconduct accusations leveled against him by two women during his confirmation to the Supreme Court in October.""Now the Radical Left Democrats and their Partner, the LameStream Media, are after Brett Kavanaugh again, talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment,"" Trump tweeted. ""He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal!""The new allegations came from Max Stier, who runs a nonprofit in Washington. His concerns were reported to the FBI during Kavanaugh's 2018 confirmation process but not investigated, according to the Times.Stier said he saw his former classmate ""with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a ­female student.""Stier has not spoken publicly about the incident but his story was corroborated by two officials, the Times said.It is the latest in a string of accusations of unwanted sexual contact or assault against Kavanaugh since Trump nominated him to the Supreme Court.Christine Blasey Ford testified before Congress that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in the 1980s, while Deborah Ramirez told The New Yorker that Kavanaugh had waved his penis in front of her face at a 1980s dormitory party.The latest allegation surfaced during a 10-month investigation by Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, and features in their upcoming book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation.Trump called on Kavanaugh to take legal action over the claims, suggesting also that the Department of Justice should intervene on the judge's behalf and ""come to his rescue.""But Democrats seeking to be Trump's opponent in the 2020 election said the judge should be investigated - and three of them called for his impeachment."
网站,Kim invites Trump to Pyongyang in new letter,"The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader Kim Jong Un invited U.S. President Donald Trump to visit Pyongyang in a letter sent in August, a Republic of Korea (ROK) newspaper reported on Monday, citing diplomatic sources.The letter, the second Trump received from Kim last month amid stalled denuclearization talks between the two countries, predated the DPRK's latest launch of short-range projectiles a week ago.In the second letter, which was passed to Trump in the third week of August, Kim spoke of his willingness to meet Trump for another summit, one source reportedly told the Joongang Ilbo newspaper."
网站,"In show of bond, Trump to join Modi in mass Houston rally","President Donald Trump will join Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a massive gathering of Indian-Americans in Houston, the White House said Sunday, in a symbolic show of the bond between the two leaders and countries.U.S. President Donald Trump meets Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for bilateral talks during the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, August 26, 2019. [File Photo: CARLOS BARRIA/Reuters via VCG]The September 22 rally -- dubbed, with a touch of Texan twang, ""Howdy, Modi!"" -- will mark a rare joint appearance between a US president and a foreign leader before an ethnic community, and be the pair's third meeting this year.Organizers say that more than 50,000 people have registered for the event, which will take place inside the NRG Stadium of the Houston Texans football team.The gathering is ""a great opportunity to emphasize the strong ties between the people of the United States and India, to reaffirm the strategic partnership between the world's oldest and largest democracies and to discuss ways to deepen their energy and trade relationship,"" the White House said.The White House said Trump would travel the same day to Ohio to showcase an Australian-owned factory alongside Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who will be on a state visit.The two joint appearances amount to a day-long attempt to nurture relationships with foreign leaders by Trump, whose brash style and outspoken remarks have frequently unnerved allies.The rally with Modi indicates that the two countries have turned the page on an incident in July when Trump baffled India by saying, in a meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, that Modi had sought mediation on Kashmir, a flashpoint for conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.India has for decades rejected any outside role in Kashmir. Last month, India revoked Kashmir's autonomous status and snapped communications for much of the Muslim-majority region.India's actions drew criticism from the UN human rights chief and rights groups, with Pakistan urging pressure on India, although Trump has voiced support for Modi's actions.- Reaching across aisle -Trump and Modi have frequently drawn comparisons to each other, with the two right-wing leaders elected on vows to promote the identity of the majority community.But organizers hope to keep the September 22 rally non-partisan, with a cultural performance planned and invited speakers including Steny Hoyer, the number-two Democrat in the House of Representatives.The joint event shows ""the personal chemistry and friendship"" between Trump and Modi, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, the Indian ambassador to the United States, told AFP.""These are two leaders who are used to thinking outside of the box,"" he said, describing the joint appearance as ""unconventional and unique.""""The event will also reflect the strong bipartisan support there has been for US-India relations,"" he said, describing Indian-Americans as an ""organic bridge"" between the world's two largest democracies.Shringla said that Modi would also meet in Houston with energy companies before heading to New York for the UN General Assembly.Some four million Americans trace their origins to India and the community is among the most educated and prosperous in the United States.The average Indian-American household earned some $100,000 in 2015, nearly double the US average, according to the Pew Research Center.But while Modi will likely enjoy a rock-star reception in Houston, Indian-Americans are not expected to be a major base for Trump as he gears up to seek another term in next year's election.Some 84 percent of Indian-Americans voted in 2016 for his rival Hillary Clinton, making them among the most Democratic-leaning ethnic groups, according to polling by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund.During the 2016 campaign, Trump took part in a rally in New Jersey at which he declared, awkwardly, ""I love Hindu."""
网站,Why is the Trump administration biased against Iran?,"Editor's Note : Huang Jiyuan is an opinion editor with CGTN Digital. This article is based on his interview with Wu Sike, Former Special Envoy of the Chinese Government on the Middle East Issue, former Chinese Ambassador to Egypt, and former Chinese Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. The opinions expressed in this article are not necessarily the views of CGTN.Two oil refineries in Saudi Arabia were attacked by drones over the weekend. Houthi movement, an armed organization operating out of Yemen, claimed responsibility for the attack. Despite the statement, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo tweeted that ""Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply"". Before his tweet, the White House said that President Donald Trump has offered Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman ""his support for Saudi Arabia's self-defense.""As the situation escalates, many have cast doubt on Trump administration's knee-jerk reaction to link the attack to Iran. U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, believes Secretary Pompeo's tweet is an ""irresponsible simplification"" and one cannot simply equate the Houthis to Iran. Besides, Saudi's own foreign ministry has been conducting its own investigation into the attack, and did not just issue a blanket condemnation on Iran. So where is the Trump administration's bias against Iran coming from?"

网站,"Top Democrats, Trump not on same page over gun legislation","Video PlayerCloseWASHINGTON, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- Democratic leaders and U.S. President Donald Trump failed to get on the same page over gun legislation after a phone conversation on Sunday.In a joint statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer urged Trump to endorse a bill that the lower chamber passed 200 days ago, which expands background checks to include guns sold at gun shows, online and through person-to-person sales.""We made it clear to the president that any proposal he endorses that does not include the House-passed universal background checks legislation will not get the job done,"" they said. ""The Senate must pass this bill and the President must sign it.""Though calling the conversation ""cordial,"" the White House said that Trump ""made no commitments"" on the bill but instead ""indicated his interest in working to find a bipartisan legislative solution on appropriate responses to the issue of mass gun violence.""The conversation came several weeks after two mass shootings, which occurred hours apart in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, took dozens of lives combined in August, and have rekindled a national debate on gun control.The Senate, controlled by the Republicans, hasn't taken up the House bill. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that the chamber is waiting for indications of what Trump is willing to sign.Chief executives of some of the nation's best-known companies last week urged the Senate to act on gun violence.""Doing nothing about America's gun violence crisis is simply unacceptable and it is time to stand with the American public on gun safety,"" read a letter signed by the heads of 145 U.S. companies, including Airbnb, Twitter, and Uber.As of Sunday, there have been 39,896 gun violence-related incidents in the United States this year, killing 10,555 people, according to Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group. The number of mass shootings has already reached 300."
网站,Trump defends Kavanaugh after latest sexual misconduct allegations,"U.S. President Donald Trump rejected Democrats' calls for impeaching Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Sunday after a new report involving sexual misconduct allegations, encouraging Kavanaugh to sue for libel and suggesting the Justice Department could ""rescue"" him.What's Kavanaugh accused of?Some Democratic presidential candidates called for Kavanaugh's impeachment, saying he lied under oath, after a New York Times report on Saturday disclosed new information about sexual misconduct allegations against him.The Times essay, drawn from an upcoming book written by the newspaper's reporters, said it was able to corroborate an allegation by former classmate Deborah Ramirez that Kavanaugh exposed his penis to her during a drunken party at a Yale University when they were undergraduates.""Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue,"" Trump wrote on Twitter.It was unclear what action the Republican president was advocating the Justice Department take."
网站,Trump: US locked and loaded for response to attack on Saudis,"A weekend drone attack on Saudi Arabia that cut into global energy supplies and halved the kingdom's oil production threatened Sunday to fuel a regional crisis, as the U.S. released new evidence to back up its allegation that Iran was responsible for the assault amid heightened tensions over Tehran's collapsing nuclear deal.United States President Donald J. Trump waves as he walks on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington upon his return from Baltimore on September 12, 2019. [Photo: Yuri Gripas/CNP/AdMedia via IC]President Donald Trump said the U.S. had reason to believe it knew who was behind the attack — his secretary of state had blamed Iran the previous day — and assured his Twitter followers that ""we are ... locked and loaded"" depending on verification and were waiting to hear from the Saudis as to who they believe was behind the attack and ""under what terms we would proceed!""The tweets followed a National Security Council meeting at the White House that included Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper.A U.S. official said all options, including a military response, were on the table, but said no decisions had been made Sunday. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the internal deliberations.Hours earlier, senior U.S. officials said satellite imagery and other intelligence showed the strike was inconsistent with one launched from Yemen, where Iranian-backed Houthi rebels had claimed responsibility.Iran, meanwhile, called the U.S. claims ""maximum lies,"" while a commander in its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard reiterated its forces could strike U.S. military bases across the Mideast with their arsenal of ballistic missiles.The U.S. government produced satellite photos showing what officials said were at least 19 points of impact at two Saudi energy facilities, including damage at the heart of the kingdom's crucial oil processing plant at Abqaiq. Officials said the photos show impacts consistent with the attack coming from the direction of Iran or Iraq, rather than from Yemen to the south.Iraq denied Sunday that its territory was used for an attack on the Kingdom and U.S. officials said a strike from there would be a violation of Iraq's sovereignty.The U.S. officials said additional devices, which apparently didn't reach their targets, were recovered northwest of the facilities and are being jointly analyzed by Saudi and American intelligence. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, did not address whether the drone could have been fired from Yemen, then taken a round-about path, but did not explicitly rule it out.The attacks and recriminations are increasing already heightened fears of an escalation in the region, after a prominent U.S. senator suggested striking Iranian oil refineries in response to the assault, and Iran warned of the potential of more violence.""Because of the tension and sensitive situation, our region is like a powder keg,"" said Iranian Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh. ""When these contacts come too close, when forces come into contact with one another, it is possible a conflict happens because of a misunderstanding.""Actions on any side could break into the open a twilight war that's been raging just below the surface of the wider Persian Gulf in recent months. Already, there have been mysterious attacks on oil tankers that America blames on Tehran, at least one suspected Israeli strike on Shiite forces in Iraq, and Iran shooting down a U.S. military surveillance drone.The attack Saturday on Saudi Arabia's Abqaiq plant and its Khurais oil field led to the interruption of an estimated 5.7 million barrels of the kingdom's crude oil production per day, equivalent to more than 5% of the world's daily supply. It remained unclear how King Salman and his assertive son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, will respond to an attack targeting the heart of the Saudi oil industry.Crude oil futures shot up 9.5% to $60 as trading opened Sunday evening in New York, a dramatic increase. A spike in oil prices could have negative effects for the global economy.Saudi Arabia has promised to fill in the cut in production with its reserves, but has not said how long it will take to repair the damage. The Wall Street Journal cited Saudi officials as saying a third of output would be restored on Monday, but a return to full production may take weeks.Trump said he had approved the release of U.S. strategic petroleum reserves ""if needed"" to stabilize energy markets. The president said the final amount of the release, if any, would be ""sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied.""Images from the European Commission's Sentinel-2 satellite examined by the AP showed black char marks at the heart of the Abqaiq plant on Sunday, marks not seen over the prior month. Identical marks are visible on the U.S. imagery. The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies in August identified the area with the char marks as the plant's stabilization area. The center said the area includes ""storage tanks and processing and compressor trains — which greatly increases the likelihood of a strike successfully disrupting or destroying its operations.""The state-run oil giant Saudi Aramco, which the kingdom hopes to offer a sliver of in a public stock offering, did not respond to a request for comment.Pompeo directly blamed Iran for the Saudi attack on Twitter late Saturday, and officials worked to provide evidence for his claim the following day.""Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply,"" Pompeo wrote. ""There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.""The U.S., Western nations, their Gulf Arab allies and U.N. experts say Iran supplies the Houthis with weapons and drones — a charge that Tehran denies.U.S. officials previously alleged at least one recent drone attack on Saudi Arabia came from Iraq, where Iran backs Shiite militias. Those militias in recent weeks have been targeted themselves by mysterious airstrikes, with at least one believed to have been carried out by Israel.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi on Sunday dismissed Pompeo's remarks as ""blind and futile comments.""""The Americans adopted the 'maximum pressure' policy against Iran, which, due to its failure, is leaning toward 'maximum lies,'"" Mousavi said in a statement.Separately, Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi's office issued a statement on Sunday denying the drone attack came from there. Oil-rich Kuwait also said it would increase security around the country's ""vital sites"" over the attacks.Houthi leader Muhammad al-Bukhaiti reiterated his group's claim of responsibility, telling The Associated Press on Sunday it exploited ""vulnerabilities"" in Saudi air defenses to strike the targets. He did not elaborate.Iran, meanwhile, kept up its own threats.Hajizadeh, the brigadier general who leads the country's aerospace program, said in an interview published across Iranian media Sunday that Revolutionary Guard forces were ready for a counterattack if America responded, naming the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar and Al-Dhafra Air Base near Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates as immediate targets, as well as U.S. Navy ships in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea.""Wherever they are, it only takes one spark and we hit their vessels, their air bases, their troops,"" he said in a video published online with English subtitles.It wasn't just Iran making threats. U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican close to Trump, suggested retaliatory strikes targeting Iran. ""Iran will not stop their misbehavior until the consequences become more real, like attacking their refineries, which will break the regime's back,"" Graham wrote on Twitter.With the U.N. General Assembly taking place in a little over a week, there had been speculation of a potential meeting between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on the summit's sidelines, possibly in exchange for the lifting of some economic sanctions the American leader imposed on Tehran after unilaterally withdrawing from the nuclear accord over a year ago.But Trump seemed to reject that idea Sunday night, tweeting: ""The Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran, 'No Conditions.' That is an incorrect statement (as usual!)."" In fact, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters last week that ""the president has said that he is prepared to meet with no conditions.""If Iran had a hand in Saturday's attack, it could be to bolster their position ahead of any talks, analysts say.""The main point for Iran, in my opinion, is not necessarily to derail a meeting between Trump and Rouhani but to increase its leverage ahead of it,"" said Michael Horowitz, the head of intelligence at the Bahrain-based risk management firm Le Beck International. ""By carrying out such a major attack, Iran wants to send the message that the only way to decrease tensions is to comply with its demands regarding sanctions relief.""However, he warned there could be a danger of Iran ""overplaying"" its hand.""There will be no political benefit for Trump in a meeting with Rouhani if this meeting sends the message that the U.S. simply surrendered to Iranian demands,"" he said."

网站,FRANKEN: Fickle Trump FRANKEN: Fickle Trump,"It’s the really big question in Washington, which goes to show how pathetic things can get here: Did John Bolton resign, or was he fired? President Donald Trump and his now former national security adviser disagree about that, much as they disagreed about everything else. It was not exactly a marriage made in heaven.To call Bolton “abrasive” is definitely an understatement. “Caustic” is more like it. Since he became the administration’s third national security adviser, he has rubbed nearly everybody in the White House the wrong way. That would include, more and more, the Trumpster, who claims to enjoy vigorous internal debate but really prefers sycophancy.It’s tempting to call John Bolton a warmonger, although Bolton would insist he’s really a “peace through strength” kinda guy. On the other hand, Donald Trump fancies himself as a master deal-maker, who can work his magic to turn enemies into partners in ending dangerous hostilities. Never mind that he has bungled each and every initiative so far. The latest one – opposed by Bolton, of course – would have brought representatives of the Taliban to Camp David, for not only a successful Afghanistan deal, but one with the kind of whiz-bang showbiz touches that Trump prefers.For those who shuddered at the idea of photo-ops showing terrorist Taliban extremists at Camp David, there was cheerleading Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, ever the Trump toady, telling Fox News that the U.S. must deal with “lots of bad folks.”The problem is that POTUS seems to prefer bad folks. He treats democratic allies like dirt while warming up to a whole roster of despots. Where do we start? He’s in “love” with Kim Jong Un and has a bromance with Vladimir Putin. Saudi Arabia’s leaders? Soul mates. Same feelings for Egyptian dictator Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.The list goes on and on. Rodrigo Duterte, who champions extrajudicial killings of accused drug dealers? He and Trump have a “great relationship.”The only absolute ruler who has a complicated relationship with The Donald is China’s Xi Jinping. That’s because the American president is trying to use intimidation to force a trade deal on President Xi sooner rather than later. Throughout history, the Chinese have chosen later. Much later. They have the largest population in the world, the second-largest economy and a history of extreme patience.Patience is not a Donald Trump strong suit, so he’s tried to use tariffs to force his will on Beijing. The only ones who are wavering are American companies and farmers. They are in an uproar not only because of the economic disruptions – which, by the way, don’t help when it comes to the fragile U.S. economy – but also because of all the uncertainty thanks to Donald Trump’s constant vacillation. He’s from the “always keep them guessing” school of deal-making. Although cognitive dissonance is a valid negotiating tactic, there comes a time when two sides must trust each other in order to reach a final bargain – and live up to it. That’s been a problem in private life, where Donald Trump would constantly stiff those with whom he did business, and it’s certainly a problem in his governance, or lack thereof. He simply can’t be pinned down during negotiations, even after he’s settled.Again, flexibility is one thing – it’s vital to compromise but capriciousness is another matter entirely. Trump is notorious for reversing course based on his last conversation, or based on the last TV show he watched on Fox. It means that every policy decision that Congress must make, whether it’s spending or gun control, whatever, can always be disrupted at the last minute.So John Bolton, whether he resigned or was fired, can thank his lucky stars he got out. Now he can go back to Fox News and right-wing think tank heaven and criticize to his heart’s content. Second-guessing is always better anyway. Certainly in Washington."
网站,Donald Trump,"‘Bye-bye’: He quit key talks over govt shutdown after top Democrats rejected his wall funding demandWASHINGTON US PresidentDonald Trumptook the shutdown battle to the US-Mexico border on Thursday, seeking to bolster his case for the border wall after negotiations with Democrats blew up over his funding demands.Trump walked out of a meeting with House SpeakerNancy Pelosiand Senate Democratic leaderChuck Schumeras efforts to end the partial government shutdown fell into deeper disarray. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers now face lost paychecks on Friday.Wednesday’s meeting, held in the White House’s Situation Room, ended after just 14 minutes. “A total waste of time. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!” Trump later tweeted about his talks with top Democratic congressional leaders. Democrats said they asked Trump to re-open the government but that he told them if he did they wouldn’t give him $5.7 billion for the wall.Schumer said Trump “sort of slammed the table” then “got up and walked out”. “Again, we saw a temper tantrum because he couldn’t get his way,” he said. On Thursday, Trump travelled to McAllen, Texas. During the stop, he will visit a border patrol station for a roundtable on immigration and border security and will get a security briefing on the border. McAllen is located in the Rio Grande Valley, the busiest part of the border for illegal crossings.The unravelling talks prompted further speculation about whether Trump would declare a national emergency and try to authorise the wall on his own if Congress won’t approve the money he’s seeking. The Democrats see the idea of the wall as ineffective and even immoral. Trump says it is an absolute necessity to stop what he calls a crisis of illegal immigration, drug-smuggling and human trafficking at the border.Nod for stir against Trump at Davos meetOfficials in Davos have authorised a protest by a Socialist youth group against Trump and other expected attendees of the annualWorld Economic Forumin the Swiss ski resort this month.

网站,Column: Trump won — again,"WASHINGTON — Watching the Democratic presidential debate Thursday night left one clear impression: Donald Trump won.Please don’t shoot the messenger. My left index finger recoiled a bit as it reached for the “T” on the keyboard. But it’s true for this reason: Democrats are too earnest. They care too much. They’re too smart. They know too much.Whoever says, as California Sen. Kamala Harris did, “The American people are so much better than this” needs to get out more.This isn’t to recommend that primary candidates should be more like Trump, not that they could. But as a panel of candidates, they’re missing a key element essential to voter interest. Not brilliant policies or the rote delivery of statistics but a clear and firm message as well as that other thing that Trump had in 2016 — “it.”We’re used to saying “it girl,” but boys have “it,” too. And it isn’t necessarily good. In fact, in men it’s probably just a little bit bad. Bad enough to attract attention, to convey toughness, to seduce with dazzle or at least bedevil those around him. Love him or hate him — or just wish him away — Trump had the X-factor in spades and jokers.Yes, yes, many Americans are surely ready for something different. But a Trump-like figure in the mix gives everyone a point of reference for contrasts and pivots.As elder statesman and Democratic front-runner, Joe Biden was the obvious person to serve this role, but he’s the opposite of the brooding, sarcastic, hunkering Trump from the 2016 campaign. Whereas Trump was the impudent scoundrel, dominating the field with the aloof self-confidence of an undefeated bully, Biden is the welcome guy at Walmart who wants to give everybody a great, big ol’ hug.Three years ago, Trump knew nothing, of course, but he made certain that viewers would not be bored. He hurled glib insults and tagged better men with insulting (but largely accurate) nicknames — and the crowds loved him. Today, Democratic contenders are so busy trying to demonstrate how un-Trump they are that they risk putting everyone to sleep. Be honest. Did you make it to the end of Thursday night’s three-hour affair?Also missing from the mix is a jester to the king. For Republicans in the 2016 cycle, it was South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. Barely registering in the polls, Graham was so liberated by the impossibility of his nomination that he said only true things, including that Trump was a “race-baiting, xenophobic bigot” and “jackass.” We watched the “kids table” GOP debates prior to the top guns just to find out what Graham would say. Miss that guy.On Thursday, the zany Andrew Yang did offer some comic relief when he said, “I’m Asian, so I know a lot of doctors,” thus supposedly making him an expert on health care. Otherwise he was plainly auditioning for a game show of his own. He offered to give $1,000 a month to 10 families for a year to show how his guaranteed minimum income policy would work. He also suggested giving all Americans $100 “democracy dollars” to spend on political causes.Former HUD Secretary Julian Castro was laughable if not funny when he tried to make Biden look little. Fuming mad in that studied, must-show-passion way, Castro jabbed Biden for “forgetting” what he had just said, which wasn’t true, but Castro was brandishing his narrative as the Latino, new-generation tough guy. It backfired.Honorable mention goes to former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who broke out with his strongest stand yet on gun control: “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,” he intoned, sounding very fierce. Also noteworthy, Biden earned a new voter bloc among the incarcerated population when he said, “Nobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime.”In sum: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was very Bernie. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was A-plus perfect. Harris was prosecutorial. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker was bookishly faithful to his narrative. Biden was grown-up. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was emphatically moderate. And South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the Mr. Rogers of American politics, would make everything tidy.Entertainment value, obviously, should play no part in a voter’s calculation. But as all public speakers know, audiences don’t remember what you said; they remember how you made them feel. Trump made people feel excited, if for all the wrong reasons. This crew? Serotonin on the rocks without a twist.© Washington Post Writers Group"

网站,Trump gets amnesia on Iran,"But Trump seems to now have amnesia about it,tweeting Sunday, ""The Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran, 'No Conditions.' That is an incorrect statement (as usual!).""Get our weekly newsletterSign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and FacebookTrump has a history of sending mixed messages regarding his intentions toward Iran. After the Iranians shot down a US drone in June, hetweeted, ""Iran made a very big mistake!"" Trump approved retaliatory strikes against Iranian missile batteries and radars and then abruptly called off the operation.In recent weeks Trump has made conciliatory statements about the Iranians. Earlier this month, Trumpsaid he could be open to meeting with Rouhani at the UN General Assembly in New York, which begins next week.Trump's recently departed national security adviser, John Bolton -- long an advocate for regime change in Iran -- opposed a suggestion from Trump that he might support lifting some of the sanctions against Iran,according to The Washington Post. This disagreement was one of the reasons for Bolton's ouster from the White House last week.Monday, a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry said there wasno possibility of a meeting between Rouhani and Trump at the General Assembly.President's foreign policy in shamblesTrump's foreign policy agenda is now largely in shambles. The much-vaunted dealmaker has seen his negotiations with the North Koreans over their nuclear program fizzle and yield scant tangible results. Trump abruptly ended negotiations with the Taliban this month. Trump's trade negotiations with the Chinese seem to be at an impasse and the possibility of an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal on his watch is close to zero.Iran is turning up the heat against the Saudis as well as the United States following the re-imposition of US sanctions against the Iranians by the Trump administration last year. The new round of US sanctions has more than halved Iran'soil exports, its key revenue source.The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its elite Quds Forces and Iranian proxies around the Middle East arefighting back to signal their anger with the Trump-imposed sanctions.The Trump administration has blamed Iran for Saturday's attack against key Saudi oil facilities thatdisrupted around half the country's oil capacity.Ramping up the ""maximum pressure"" campaign on the Iranians has helped lead to Saturday's serious attack on the Saudis, a close US ally, which has put global oil markets into a tailspin and simultaneously ramped up the possibility of a wider regional war. Art of the Deal, indeed.The Iranians havedenied responsibility for Saturday's attack, which is their routine response when they or their proxies carry out attacks in the region.President Trumptweeted Sunday that the United States is ""locked and loaded depending on verification"" of who was behind Saturday's attack in Saudi Arabia.The negotiated pathSo what will happen between Trump and Iran? Negotiations are vastly preferable to a war. And that seems to be Trump's natural inclination.The President sent additional troops to Afghanistan only reluctantly in 2017 and was pursuing a withdrawal agreement with the Taliban until he abruptly canceled the negotiations earlier this month. At the end of 2018, he said he was going to pull all US troops out of Syria, precipitating the resignation of the secretary of defense, Jim Mattis. Trump has gone from threatening ""fire and fury"" on the North Koreans to declaring his ""love"" for Kim Jong Un.Now Trump has only an acting national security adviser in place to coordinate the range of military and diplomatic courses of action he might choose from to retaliate against Iran at a time when he has his first genuine foreign policy crisis to deal with.Does anyone know what Trump's achievable end goals are with Iran, including the President himself?"
网站,What Is the Trump Doctrine?,"The most accurate measure of a man is who he counts as his friends and who he counts as his enemies. John Bolton has a lot of friends and allies in the American national security community, myself included. When Bolton resigned from the national security adviser’s job, the fastest praise for his defenestration came from Iran, Russia, and Sen. Rand Paul.A spokesman for the Tehran kakistocracy said, “John Bolton had promised months ago that Iran would last for another three months. We are still standing and he is gone. With the expulsion of the biggest proponent of war and economic terrorism, the White House will face fewer obstacles in understanding Iran’s realities.”Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said, with a wink and a nod, that he had “no expectation” that relations between Russia and the U.S. would improve “immediately.”Perhaps their view was best summarized by isolationist-libertarian Rand Paul, who said that the threat of war is much lower with Bolton out of the White House. In that he was, as is not unusual, categorically wrong.Bolton is certainly a hawk, which means that he takes strong opposition to the aggression of other nations — such as Iran — and is wary of America’s adversaries including Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and a bunch of lesser powers.But to call Bolton a neocon interventionist is inaccurate as well. Being wary, suspicious, and altogether realistic about our enemies is not equivalent to wanting to start a war with one or all of them.The question going forward, no matter whom Trump picks for his fourth national security adviser, is: What coherent set of ideas is the president pursuing in foreign policy? Is there a “Trump Doctrine,” or is there only a “let’s make a deal” transactional policy that only sometimes coincides with America’s interests?Great leaders set their doctrines clearly in stated policy. Ronald Reagan said America’s mission was to “nourish and defend freedom and democracy.” He declared, “We must stand by our democratic allies. And we must not break faith with those who are risking their lives — on every continent, from Afghanistan to Nicaragua — to defy Soviet-supported aggression and secure rights which have been ours from birth.” He added, “Support for freedom fighters is self-defense.”From that clear statement of America’s interests — and the derivative “peace through strength” motto — came diplomacy, economic and military competition, collaboration with heroes such as Poland’s Lech Wałęsa, and the fall of the Soviet Union.Trump has made no such statement of foreign or military policy. His actions have been all over the map.In a press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump was asked whether he believed our intelligence community or Putin on the subject of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. He said he gave equal credence to them both. More recently, he has advocated that Russia should be readmitted to the G7, from which it has been thrown out because of its conquest of Crimea.On the other hand, Trump has imposed some severe economic sanctions on Russia.Trump boldly traveled to Korea to meet with Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s absolute ruler. Perhaps as a result, North Korea has ceased long-range missile tests as well as nuclear tests. (It’s more likely true that the Norks’ nuclear test site at Punggye-ri has collapsed the mountain above it, making it unusable.) But there is no foreseeable agreement with the Norks for them to give up their nuclear weapons and accept inspections of their nuclear and ICBM sites. Nevertheless, Trump has proclaimed that he and Kim have fallen in love with each other.We saw the proposed Camp David summit with Taliban leaders get canceled after the Taliban killed the fourth U.S. soldier in two weeks. That “summit” was the product of a yearlong negotiation that didn’t produce an agreement, only the outline of one. And those negotiations were held without even a demand by Trump that the Taliban agree to a cease-fire before the talks could begin.Bolton reportedly resigned over the proposed Taliban Camp David summit and because the president said he wanted to relieve Iran of some of the economic sanctions he’d imposed against it. Both were enormously bad ideas.Trump’s economic sanctions have brought the Iranian economy to the brink of ruin, despite France’s and Germany’s efforts to sustain it. But Trump may, at any time, meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani without preconditions.From these actions, we can conclude that Trump enjoys violating the normal practices of diplomacy, a tactic that in and of itself is perfectly fine. But we have to further conclude that his eagerness to make deals overcomes his dealmaking skill.By continuing to cozy up with Putin, Trump is leading Americans and our allies astray. He apparently doesn’t understand that an essential part of his job as leader of the free world is speaking clearly about America’s interests and how others such as Putin, Kim, Rouhani, and China’s Xi Jinping are working relentlessly against them.How can our allies take seriously the fact that Putin, for example, is our enemy when the president is so eager to embrace Putin? How can the American people understand how important our opposition to Putin, Kim, Rouhani, and Xi is without presidential clarity on that issue?Simply put, they can’t. Thus, our European allies are making themselves dependent on Russian gas supplies. They are working hard to trade with Iran to evade our sanctions and scolding us for Trump’s tariff war with China. Americans, in the rare moment when they even think about those issues, must be convinced that we aren’t seriously threatened by Putin, Kim, Rouhani, and Xi, among others. The president is the only person who can do that, but he refrains from doing so.Trump’s doctrine, if there is one, almost resembles that of Henry John Temple, Lord Palmerston, who served during the reign of Queen Victoria.In 1848, Lord Palmerston told the British parliament, “We have no eternal allies, and we have no perpetual enemies. Our interests are eternal, and those interests it is our duty to follow.”There is one huge difference between Palmerston’s approach to Germany at the time of Russian aggression and, for example, Trump’s agreeing to a summit with the Taliban. Palmerston had a clear vision of Britain’s interests in the ever-changing balance of power between nations. Trump, who seems to grasp at virtually any deal, apparently doesn’t have nearly as clear an understanding of America’s interests.In making any deal, whether it’s a commercial real estate deal or a negotiation with an international adversary, both sides use every bit of leverage they have to gain the best agreement they can. When Trump gave equal credence to our intelligence agencies and Putin, he surrendered the leverage the intelligence agencies gave him. He gained nothing and lost every ounce of leverage they had given him. By agreeing to negotiations with the Taliban — far less a summit — without a cease-fire, he gave up what little leverage we have left in Afghanistan.The loss of John Bolton from Trump’s team removes Bolton’s balancing influence on Trump. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently doesn’t press the president to avoid obvious errors as Bolton did in opposing the proposed Taliban summit and, certainly, many other issues. Trump is going to do what he wants to do.This week, after Tuesday’s elections in Israel, Trump may unveil the political half of his proposed “deal of the century” between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The economic part of the deal, which offered billions in economic aid to the Palestinians, was already rejected by them.Any “land for peace” exchange in the political half of the deal has already been effectively rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu has said Israel will annex much of the West Bank territory if he is re-elected and said Trump has agreed with it. In short, there’s no reason to believe that Trump’s proposed deal will be accepted by either side.Americans, our allies, and our enemies still don’t know just what the “Trump Doctrine” may be. If the president studied more of what Lord Palmerston said and meant in his many speeches and spent a weekend at Camp David with Henry Kissinger, perhaps he could decide just what it is."

He said the increased natural gas production means better wages and more jobs.“You’re doing better than any state in the United States,” Trump said. “How do I lose New Mexico? Explain that one.”Trump hopes to win New Mexico in 2020Trump visited New Mexico in hopes that he can win the state after losing it in 2016. Hillary Clinton received 385,234 votes — a little more than 48 percent of the votes cast in New Mexico — in 2016 while Trump received 319,667 votes, or approximately 40 percent. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson received 74,541 votes.Buy PhotoIt didn't take long for the Santa Ana Star Center to start filling up once the doors opened.(Photo: Hannah Grover/The Daily Times)Twice the speech was interrupted by booing from someone in the crowd. Each time Trump’s supporters responded by cheering until they drowned out the sound of the protests.“You must never forget the 2020 election is about one thing. What’s it about? It’s about you,” Trump said toward the end of his speech.He added that the election is “about your family. It’s about your future and it’s about the fate of your country for your children, for everybody.”The president focused on Hispanic votersThroughout the speech, he routinely circled back to Hispanic American voters, even mentioning that it is Hispanic Heritage Month. He said his policies, such as border security, are especially important for Hispanic American voters.He said Democrats place the rights of undocumented immigrants above the rights of American citizens.“Right here in New Mexico, Democrats are trying to turn you into a total sanctuary state,” he said.He warned that if immigration laws are not enforced that violent criminals will be released onto the streets.Buy PhotoPresident Donald Trump's Communications Director Tim Murtaugh told reporters on Sept. 16, 2019 before the rally that Trump's campaign visit to New Mexico is a strategic move.(Photo: Hannah Grover/The Daily Times)“Republicans believe our cities should be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens,” Trump said.He said border security is at the heart of the opioid epidemic in the United States because the cartels are bringing drugs, including fentanyl, into the United States.“Whether you’re a first generation or a tenth generation, every American citizen deserves a government that defends your jobs, your safety, your family and is always loyal to you,” Trump said. “Your politicians have not been loyal to you. They’ve been loyal to themselves.”He assured people at the rally that the border wall is being built and will be built in New Mexico.Trump says unemployment is decreasing for Native AmericansHe briefly touched on Native Americans as well when he said unemployment among Native Americans has reached the lowest point in nearly two decades.He also referred to Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas and criticized her claim that she is part Native American.“I have more Indian blood than she does and I have none,” Trump said.Buy PhotoPresident Donald Trump speaks to the crowd at his campaign rally Sept. 16, 2019 in Rio Rancho.(Photo: Sam Ribakoff/The Daily Times)Warren has received backlash after using a genetic test to bolster her claim.Trump touts trade deal with Mexico, CanadaTrump said New Mexico was devastated by the North American Free Trade Agreement, also known as NAFTA. NAFTA was a trade agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada that was signed by President Bill Clinton. Trump said NAFTA led to a loss of manufacturing jobs in New Mexico. He then touted a renegotiated trade agreement known as United States Mexico Canada Agreement, or USMCA. He said people can remember the acronym by thinking of the song “YMCA.”The agreement still needs to be ratified by Canada and approved by the U.S. Congress.Trump also criticized Democratic Party platforms on issues like late-term abortion and gun control. The crowd erupted in cheers when he said he would not infringe on citizens’ rights to bear arms.He also received cheers when he said the AIDS epidemic in the country will be gone in 10 years.Trump continues discussion about light bulbsLast week Trump announced he would be rolling back energy efficiency requirements scheduled to go into effect in January for light bulbs. The announcement got widespread attention after he said the energy efficient light bulbs make his skin look orange. He touched on that subject at the rally as well.""You pay less money and you look better,"" he said about light bulbs that don't meet the energy efficiency requirements that would have gone into effect.He said the energy-efficient light bulbs are also considered hazardous waste if they break.Senate candidate attends rallySenate candidate Mick Rich commented on how energetic the crowd was at the rally. He had come to the rally after visiting the New Mexico State Fair.He expressed support for Trump’s proposals and said the two things Trump focused on were the economy and border security.

Tom Udall, D-NM.He said some people would hand his card back to him when he said he was a Republican.

网站,"Trump economic adviser tries to reassure amid market volatility, Trump complaints - CNNPolitics","The attempt at reassurance from a chief economic adviser to Trump came as Wall Streetsought to pick up following its worst Christmas Eve performance on record and the partial government shutdown went through its fifth day.Markets rebounded sharply Wednesday from a disastrous Christmas Eve. The Dow was up 500 points by midday, the S&P 500 rose 2.4% and Nasdaq was up about 3%.Throughout the holiday period, Trump has railed against the Federal Reserve, tweeting at one point that it was the ""only problem our economy has.""The President's continued campaign against Powell, a former investment banker chosen last year by Trump to succeed Janet Yellen, breaks the decades-old precedent of shielding the world's most powerful central bank from political meddling -- but is in keeping with Trump's habit of publicly railing about appointees and aides he believes are damaging his political standing.Aides are exploring the possibility of having Trump meet personally with Powell in the new year, a person familiar with the discussions told CNN.Some of the President's aides believe a face-to-face meeting could help ease tensions and allow the two men to discuss the underlying economy.Mnuchin meets regularly with Powell and it is not unheard of for a Fed chair to meet with the President, though it is rare because the position is meant to be independent of politics.Nothing has been formally scheduled.The Wall Street Journal first reported the discussions about the meeting.Over the weekend, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin set off market anxiety after hesought to reassure investors about the partial shutdown with a statement saying that major banks have ""ample liquidity.""Far from calming the markets, the movesseemed to exacerbate Wall Street concerns. A sourcetold CNN afterward that Trump's frustration with Mnuchin had grown, although Trumppublicly vouched for Mnuchin on Christmas.Hassett reiterated on Wednesday that there's no liquidity crisis, as there was in 2008.He also dismissed questions about whether the partial shutdown will affect the economy or if it has played a role in market volatility.""In the end, a few week shutdown is not going to be something that has any kind of significant effect on the outlook,"" he said."
网站,3 countries where Trump is popular,"President Donald Trump is one of the most controversial world leaders in modern times, igniting the ire of America's staunchest allies.Whether it's the proposed Muslim ban, the U.S. border wall and immigration, or his praise of authoritarian leaders, Trump is deft at inciting deep divisions among the public.In 2018, political scientist Daniel Drezner summarized this consensus in The Washington Post: ""The world hates President Trump.""Data from the Pew Research Center illustrates Drezner's thinking. For the residents of U.S. allies, their confidence in the U.S. president dropped substantially from the last year of Obama's presidency to the beginning of Trump's time in office.So, where might Trump be popular overseas, and just where might he be electable? As a political scientistwho has written about the U.S. image abroad, this question fascinates me.Authoritarian states like TrumpMost of the world might hate Trump, but in some places, based largely on his policies, there is hope and even admiration.In 2016 and 2017, Gallup asked respondents in more than 100 countries, ""Do you approve or disapprove of the job performance of the leadership of the United States?"" In 29 countries, Trump outdid Obama in terms of job performance.When I look at these countries and compare them with data from Freedom House on which countries are democracies and nondemocracies, a pattern emerges. Trump is more popular than Obama among people in authoritarian nations.NigeriaAmong regions around the world that seem to feel the most pro-Trump, Africa stands out.In January 2018, The Washington Post reported that Trump derided immigrants coming from Haiti, El Salvador and African countries. Trump said, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" He added, ""We need more people from Norway.""The African Union issued an immediate response: ""Given the historical reality of how many Africans arrived in the United States as slaves, this statement flies in the face of all accepted behavior and practice.""Nigeria's response, however, was more tepid. A few months later, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari was the first head of state from sub-Saharan Africa to visit the White House. When pressed on the matter of Trump's remarks at a joint press conference, Buhari remarked, ""I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation against the president was true or not,"" adding, ""So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet.""What could explain this turn of events? One explanation may be that Nigerians like Trump. According to data from the Pew Research Center, Nigerian confidence in Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs was at 59% in 2018, higher than some points during the Obama administration.Data on Trump's total followers on Twitter may also shed some light. As of this writing, among those active Twitter accounts that follow Trump, those based in Nigeria rank in the top five. But this is notwithstanding the fact that more and more Twitter accounts are hacked and sometimes controlled by bots.Some of Trump's foreign policies in Nigeria might explain his relative popularity. In February 2017, President Trump approved the sale of jet fighters to the Nigerian government, reversing a policy from the Obama administration. This aided the Nigerian government in its campaign against Boko Haram.South KoreaSouth Korea is another country where the public is warming to Trump's approach - particularly with North Korea.Trump has made it a major priority of his administration to develop a personal relationship with North Korea's reclusive leader, Kim Jong Un. To date, Trump has had three face-to-face meetings with Kim.Until Trump, a sitting American president had never visited with a North Korean head of state while in office. Prior to Trump's tenure, the highest-level visit between these two countries ever was former President Bill Clinton's trip to Pyongyang in 2009.Although Trump is still far from being beloved among South Koreans, they see his meetings with Kim as a good thing overall for the Korean peninsula. Confidence in Trump has risen, from 17% in 2017 to 44% in 2018 among people in South Korea.And data from Gallup's Korean headquarters illustrate that favorability toward Trump among South Koreans has more than doubled, from a paltry 9% in 2017 to a high of 32% in 2018.Part of the reason for Trump's relative success with North Korea to date is South Korea's concurrent interest in fostering more high-profile diplomatic talks between Washington and Pyongyang.IsraelIf there's one place in the world where Trump's policies seem to be enjoying the most public support, it would be Israel.That same month, after Trump pledged to move the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Netanyahu compared Trump to King Cyrus the Great, from 2,500 years ago, who ""proclaimed that the Jewish exiles in Babylon could come back and rebuild our Temple in Jerusalem.""As in the case of Nigeria and South Korea, Trump's popularity in Israel seems to be a reversal of his predecessor. Frosty personal relations plagued Obama and Netanyahu, beginning with Obama's first major foreign policy address to the Arab world in Cairo in 2009. This culminated in Netanyahu's visit to Congress in 2015, when he urged Congress to oppose the Iran nuclear agreement.In 2016, prior to the rise of Trump, Israelis ranked Obama as the worst U.S. president for Israel in the last 30 years.Trump, in the meantime, has surpassed Obama and is far more beloved in Israel. In July 2018, a poll found that since the election of Donald Trump, 53% of Israelis felt U.S. standing in the world had gotten stronger, compared to just 14% who felt it had stayed the same and 21% who felt it was weakened.Author: Monti Datta - Associate Professor of Political Science, University of Richmond"

网站,Kim invites Trump to Pyongyang,"President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un: an invitation to PyongyangNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un invited U.S. President Donald Trump to visit Pyongyang in a letter sent in August, a South Korean newspaper reported on Monday, citing diplomatic sources.The letter, the second Trump received from Kim last month amid stalled denuclearization talks between the two countries, pre-dated North Korea’s latest launch of short-range projectiles a week ago.In the second letter, which was passed to Trump in the third week of August, Kim spoke of his willingness to meet Trump for another summit, one source reportedly told the Joongang Ilbo newspaper.The White House, the U.S. State Department and the North Korean mission to the United Nations all did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Trump and Kim have met three times since June last year to discuss ways to resolve a crisis over North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs, but substantive progress has been scant.The pair last met at the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas in June and agreed to restart working-level negotiations that had been stalled since an unsuccessful second summit between the two leaders in Vietnam in February.Last week’s round of short-range missiles came just hours after Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said North Korea was willing to have “comprehensive discussions” late this month.Trump subsequently said he would be willing to meet Kim at some point later this year.Trump said on Aug. 9 he had received a three-page “very beautiful letter” from Kim and added he could have another meeting with himShare this:TweetMore"
网站,Trump’s coming to the Bay Area this week. So is the gigantic Baby Trump balloon. Trump’s coming to the Bay Area this week. So is the gigantic Baby Trump balloon.,"President Donald Trump is coming to the Bay Area on Tuesday morning, which means activists with the Backbone Campaign need to get their helium ready.As part of a conga line of protests being organized against the president’s rare fundraising visit, cloaked in secrecy but possibly taking place in the tony Peninsula enclave of Atherton, the Backboners have raised more than $3,000 on Facebook to launch a gigantic baby-Trump-in-diapers balloon near his events in the Bay Area and, later, in San Diego.Other anti-Trump groups are planning protests in a part of Northern California that the president considers enemy territory. But the Backbone Campaign folks are taking a decidedly saucy and irreverent approach to show their displeasure with the man in the White House.“President Trump is coming to CA on September 17th and 18th, and we’re going to show him that he is not welcome here,” according to a Facebook fundraising page set up by the Seattle area-based group, whose self-described mission is to “amplify the aspirations of ‘We the People’ with creative strategies and artful activism to manifest a world where life, community, nature, and our obligations to future generations are honored as sacred.”Here are some things to know about the group and its artful aspirations:Who are they?Created in 2003 by Seattle activist Bill Moyer, the Backbone Campaign espouses a theory and practice of “artful activism,” in which performing-arts tenets are melded with political strategies to spawn nonviolent social change. Moyer and his colleagues have created and produced hundreds of creative protests, including demonstrations that feature spotlights to project political messages onto the sides of buildings.How did it start?Moyer co-founded the Backbone Campaign with “friends from an artist affinity group,” according to its website. “He has dual and intersecting paths as both an activist and artist. His involvement with social change work stretches back to the 80’s, when as a student he was deeply involved in the anti-nuclear movement and the anti-interventionist movement.” Moyer has studied political science and American philosophy, worked with members of the Navajo Nation on land issues, attended the Institute for Social Ecology, and lived for while on an organic vegetable farm in Vermont.What’s their message?The group’s motto says it all: “When the people lead, the leaders follow.” And it says it’s working “across the country to build a broad social movement that honors life, community, nature, and our obligations to future generations as sacred.”What’s the group’s plan during Trump’s Bay Area visit?The Backbone Campaign says it wants to mobilize its “Baby Trump” balloon to fly during the president’s visits in both the Bay Area and San Diego. “This means we need to raise money for helium (which is the single biggest expense) and transportation costs! We are estimating to do both days this will cost us approx $4800 (which will also cover a bit of our organizational overhead costs),” the group said on a Facebook fundraising page. “All donations help! Whether it’s $1, $5, or $100, it all adds up, and help to get the Baby into the air!”Where will they fly the Baby Trump balloon?“We have heard that the Bay Area event will be in the town of Atherton, just slightly northwest of Menlo Park, and south of Redwood City,” the group also said on the Facebook fundraising page, even though Atherton police have said that that plan has changed and it’s unclear where the president will be Tuesday. “We do not know an exact location yet, but it is a ‘luncheon’ so it will likely happen sometime between 10am and 2pm. After this event he will be heading to Beverley Hills for dinner, and will likely spend the night in LA before heading to San Diego in the morning.“We have little information about the San Diego event,” said the group, “but news media seems to think that there will be some kind of public event apart from the fundraiser, possibly related to the Border Patrol or the Wall. If he plans to go to the Border or meet with Border Patrol, then we will fly baby Trump down there. If he goes to visit a military base, then we will plan to fly it outside the base.”How much money have they raised so far for the balloon?As of Monday morning, the group has raised $3,842 from 163 people in 14 days — enough, they say, for the helium they need to send the balloon skyward.What is their goal?Since the Backbone Campaign is a 501(c)(3) organization, they say they “cannot engage in partisan politics, or support or endorse any candidate or party. This also means we cannot directly interfere with candidates or parties that are raising money, as this will threaten our tax-exempt status. So, as a non-profit, non-partisan organization we want to make it clear that Backbone is not, and cannot, protest the RNC and the Trump Campaign.”The group said on the Facebook fundraising page that it plans “to have the Baby set up close by, but not directly in front of the fundraiser entrance (but there is nothing stopping any individual from moving closer to the fundraiser). If Trump’s only appearance in San Diego is at the RNC fundraiser then the Baby, like the Bay Area event, will need to remain a block or two away from the fundraiser entrance to not give the appearance of directly protesting the RNC.”What are some of the props they use to beef up their protests?The group’s site includes these protest props: “Guerrilla Light Projection, Overpass Light Brigade LED Panels, Giant Overpass Banners,Giant 2D & 3D Imagery, Papier-mache Puppets, Helium-assisted Banner Lifts”So what exactly is the point of the Baby Trump balloon?“This is a protest against the President of the United States, and his Administration,” says the Backbone Campaign on the Facebook fundraising page, which criticizes the president as “a complete buffoon who has made this nation the laughing stock of the world.” They demand that Trump resign and ask Vice President Mike Pence to do so as well."

We’ll see?”His comments come a day after Trump tweeted that the U.S. was “locked and loaded” after the attack but was waiting on Saudi Arabia to verify who was responsible. Trump didn’t mention Iran explicitly but said the U.S. has “reason to believe that we know the culprit.”Iran has denied involvement in the attacks. Meanwhile, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility for the attacks and threatened further strikes in Saudi Arabia.The Saudi-led military coalition said Monday that preliminary evidence indicates that the weapons used in the attack were Iranian and that the drone strikes did not originate from Yemen.The developments have thwarted any potential for a meeting between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly in New York City, with Iran’s foreign ministry dismissing the possibility early Monday.Saturday's attacks on the oil facilities, which are run by state-owned Saudi Aramco, shut down roughly 5 percent of the global oil supply and sent prices skyrocketing.The attacks have dominated the president’s Twitter feed over the last few days.Trump spoke with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman by phone on Sunday to offer U.S. support for Saudi Arabia’s self-defense. Later, Trump said he would authorize the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if necessary in order to keep markets well-supplied.Reports have suggested the Trump administration is weighing a serious military response to the attack, though it’s unclear what, if any, action the president will ultimately take. Trump is poised to depart for a campaign rally in New Mexico later Monday, and then to California for fundraisers before returning to D.C. on Wednesday.Trump’s tweets have harkened back to his rhetoric after Iran shot down the U.S. military drone in June. Trump approved airstrikes against Iran following the drone incident but said he called them off at the last minute after being told it would lead to more than 100 casualties, saying the U.S. had been “cocked and loaded” to retaliate.Trump has increased economic sanctions on Iran following his withdrawal from the Obama-era pact between six countries and Iran meant to restrain Tehran’s nuclear program, and tensions have worsened in recent months following the downing of the U.S. drone.Still, Trump has appeared more open to meeting with Iran to potentially ease the confrontation. Some also suspected the administration’s rhetoric on Iran may soften following the ouster of White House national security adviser John BoltonJohn BoltonLiz Cheney says world is more stable, 'safer' under TrumpBolton exit provokes questions about Trump shift on IranTrump needs a national security adviser who 'speaks softly'MORElast week.Trump had acknowledged the possibility of a meeting with Rouhani, telling reporters in recent weeks that “anything is possible” and expressing optimism that Iran is willing to reach some kind of agreement.Trump last week didn’t rule out easing sanctions on Iran in order to meet with Rouhani, something Iran has said would need to happen in order for him to agree to a meeting.“We’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters when asked during an Oval Office meeting on e-cigarettes if he would consider easing sanctions to make a meeting happen.“I think Iran has a tremendous, tremendous potential,” Trump continued. “They’re incredible people. They have — we’re not looking for regime change. We hope that we can make a deal, and if we can’t make a deal, that’s fine too, OK? That’s fine too. But I think they have to make a deal. They’ve never been in this condition.”On Sunday, Trump denied he was willing to meet with Rouhani without conditions, contradicting past statements by Pompeo and other administration officials that Trump would not set preconditions for such a meeting."

网站,No meeting scheduled with Iran: Trump,"US President Donald Trump said here that he has no plans to meet his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the ongoing 74th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA).When asked about any possibility of a meeting with Rouhani in New York this week, Trump said: “We’ll see what happens. But we have nothing scheduled at this moment.”Trump made the remarks before meeting Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Xinhua news agency.Also on Monday, Trump revealed that he would touch upon Iran in his speech at the General Assembly on Tuesday.Last week, the Iranian Foreign Ministry ruled out the likelihood of any meeting between Rouhani and Trump during the UNGA in New York.The US has accused Iran of being responsible for the September 14 attacks on oil production facilities in Saudi Arabia, which Tehran has denied.On September 20, Washington announced the latest round of a maximum pressure campaign against Tehran, including sanctions targeting Iran’s central bank and its national development fund as well as the deployment of more US military assets to the Gulf."
网站,Failures of Trump's foreign policy,"WASHINGTON — The strangest thing about President Trump's aborted plan to fly the Taliban to Camp David wasn't the terrible symbolism of hosting terrorists three days before the anniversary of 9/11 — although that was bad enough.Even crazier was Trump's underlying premise: that he could sweet-talk Taliban leaders to end the war in Afghanistan by luring them to a weekend in the bucolic Maryland countryside.But Trump doesn't understand diplomacy. It's not about splashy deals and self-aggrandizing stunts; it's about nurturing alliances and building relationships. It's not done on a whim; it takes time and preparation. And the purpose isn't to make the president look good; it's the harder work of averting crises and ending wars.This isn't just me saying this. That's the advice of America's most seasoned diplomats.""Even when Trump's instincts are correct, like the need to explore a deal with the Taliban after 18 years of bloody stalemate . (his) illusions, impulsiveness and incompetence smother any glimmer of diplomatic possibility,"" William J. Burns, who served as a senior diplomat under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, told me. ""There's nothing wrong with disruptive diplomacy. But what we've seen from Trump is lots of disruption, and very little diplomacy.""The president keeps making the same mistake: seeking headline-grabbing summits with his adversaries in hopes of landing a big deal and burnishing his image as a statesman.It hasn't worked. It didn't even work when he tried it with Democratic leaders in Congress.Yes, he got three made-for-TV summits with North Korea's Kim Jong Un. But Kim is still testing missiles and building nuclear weapons, which is what those meetings were supposed to end.Yet the president and his aides count his North Korea talks as a win. He wants to try the same playbook with Iran. On Monday, he repeated his offer to meet with Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani.""I always say having a meeting is a good thing,"" Trump explained.On the general principle, he's right. But Trump doesn't have what's required to make his foreign policy work.First, the White House needs a clear strategy and a cohesive staff. Trump has neither. His foreign policy team has been chronically divided.On Tuesday, Trump fired his third national security advisor, John Bolton. Bolton opposed the proposed deal with the Taliban, opposed Trump's bromance with Kim, and opposed negotiations with Iran. The real question is why he took the job at all.Second, an administration needs to know where it has leverage against adversaries and where it doesn't. Trump has often overestimated U.S. strength and underestimated the tenacity of others. And he has avoided working within alliances, which earlier presidents considered a key asset. Trump prefers to go it alone.Third, complex diplomacy requires careful groundwork, mostly out of public view. The Obama administration's controversial nuclear deal with Iran, which Burns helped arrange, took more than two years of negotiations — after more than four years of secret contacts.Trump prefers Twitter storms and televised summits. He boasts that he trusts his gut, not briefing books.All those factors helped sink his Taliban gambit.His staff was at odds over whether the draft agreement, which called for a partial pullout of U.S. troops in exchange for Taliban promises, was acceptable. Trump apparently hoped to win more concessions from the Taliban at Camp David. The Taliban declined to be props for his reelection campaign or to be mousetrapped into new negotiations. They wanted the deal inked in Qatar, where the talks took place.It didn't help that Trump repeatedly said he wanted to bring U.S. troops home as soon as possible. That gave the Taliban little reason to change course.Trump's other experiments in personal diplomacy have yielded meager results as well.In North Korea, he claims an unlikely friendship with Kim — ""We fell in love,"" Trump said — but it hasn't produced any signs of nuclear disarmament.North Korea continues to manufacture nuclear warheads and test short-range missiles that threaten South Korea and Japan. There's no sign that Kim is willing to give up his nuclear arsenal, the core U.S. goal.On China, Trump has escalated tariff wars that have increased costs to American consumers, farmers and manufacturers. But they haven't produced the improved trade deals he promised.""His record is pitiful,"" Robert B. Zoellick, chief U.S. trade negotiator under President George W. Bush, wrote in the Wall Street Journal. ""Even by the president's own measure, the U.S. trade deficit, he's losing.""In the Middle East, Trump set his sights on the biggest diplomatic deal of all, a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, and appointed his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to oversee it.But Kushner still hasn't publicly unveiled his long-promised peace proposal, and no negotiations have occurred. Last week, the chief Middle East negotiator, a former real estate lawyer for Trump's family business, resigned.Trump can claim a few modest wins. He jawboned several NATO allies to increase their defense budgets. He pushed Canada and Mexico to update the North American Free Trade Agreement, although the Senate hasn't ratified it. And he got an updated trade deal with South Korea.But those are hardly the successes the president promised. What he's doing hasn't worked. And there's no sign he's learned any lessons.Come 2020, voters will be entitled to look at his foreign policy record and ask: Where are the deals?"

网站,Trump does not stop worrying for Obama,"In none of his tweets, Trump did not specify the wrongdoings that could have occurred in the agreement between Netflix and Obama, nor in his memory agreement with Random House, announced in 2017. The office Obama did not want to comment.But the new criticism equates to the latest evidence of Trump's persistent fixation on Obama, which he has met in person only once since the day of the inauguration.He accused him of spying on his Trump Tower campaign office. He attributes a host of foreign policy issues to him, from the Middle East to North Korea. And he said his trade policy put America on his heels.Not to mention the ""birther conspiracy"" nurtured by Trump before arguing for the presidency himself, a racist lie that he has spread by using regular appearances in Fox News and other television programs. His outrage only deepened when Obama mocked him at the White House Correspondents Dinner speech in 2011 and that TV cameras found Trump scowling in the audience.At the same time, Trump sought to dismantle some of Obama's key achievements, particularly in environmental protection and health care. On Monday, he boasted on Twitter of overtaking Obama's judicial appointments – an effort primarily fueled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who pushed candidates to Trump to override the lack of a major legislation.Home turf for TrumpIn attacking Obama's post-presidential trade deal with Netflix and Random House, Trump is exploring two areas – television contracts and book publishing – he knows it well. His book ""Art of the Deal"" and the NBC reality show ""The Apprentice"" played a vital role in creating the exaggerated image of a billionaire businessman who helped him. to be propelled to the White House. He remains an avid television consumer, watching hours of cable news daily, even though he does not know much about reading.""He used television to become president in so many ways, but television became the chair, because what he saw on television set his agenda, controlled his mood, and determined the world in which he lived. we would live, ""added New York Times chief critic James Poniewozik – whose book"" Audience of One: Donald Trump, Television and America's Fracture ""was released last week – said to Brian Stelter from CNN the ""Reliable Sources"" podcast.On Monday, Trump's tweets on targeted deals brought tens of millions of dollars to Obama. Neither company has publicly disclosed the terms of their contracts, but sources of publications have placed the advance accounting north of $ 60 million for memoirs of the former president and the first lady.Michelle Obama's book, ""Becoming,"" is the best-selling book of 2018 and one of the most popular political memoirs. The former president, meanwhile, writes his letter in hand and should not be published until at least next year.Netflix's production agreement, announced more than a year ago, led to the creation of ""Higher Ground Productions"", which will create a wide range of programs for the streaming service. The first part included the documentary factory, a drama series on women and people of color who lived in New York after World War II, as well as a Frederick Douglas biopic adapted from a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography.The tradition holds?Obama is not expected to produce too much political programming – a continuation of their preference to largely avoid direct criticism of the current president. This is a model that other former presidents have followed after leaving office.It is usually the President-in-Office who does the same, although former leaders – including Obama – blamed some of their problems on the men who preceded them. None, however, went there with the same enthusiasm as Trump.The president only made his attacks worse while Obama's vice president, Joe Biden, was fighting over the Democratic nomination for president. He accused the duo of agreeing to a ""catastrophic"" deal on Iran's nuclear power that would allow ""pallets of money"" to be sent to Tehran, although Trump recently expressed his own openness to offering Iranians a line of credit the negotiations.During talks with North Korea, Trump lamented the nuclear situation that had not been handled by previous administrations. He claimed that Obama had been seeking his own meeting with Kim Jong Un, the dictator with whom Trump had developed a friendship (Obama advisers deny that there were any overtures to Kim).The only time the men met for in-depth interviews was held at the White House soon after the 2016 elections. Next, Obama warned Trump that North Korea could prove to be his biggest problem insoluble. But Trump reinforced this warning by saying that Obama would have told him that he would soon be at war with the country.Since that meeting at the Oval Office, the two men have barely spoken. They met in person only once, during the national funeral of President George H. W. Bush, exchanging professional handshakes on the front benches of the National Cathedral before the start of service."
网站,Trump at a pivotal crossroads on Iran,"Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who are supported by Tehran, took credit for Saturday’s attacks. But the Trump administration is strongly suggesting Iran is to blame, raising the specter of U.S. military action in the region.ADVERTISEMENTTrump indicated Monday he hasn’t yet decided how to respond, saying only that “we’d certainly like to avoid” war.“We have a lot of options, but I’m not looking at options right now. We want to find definitively who did this,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.The president said it’s “certainly looking” like Iran is responsible, while also asserting that the United States knows the “exact locations” where the attacks originated.“That was an attack on Saudi Arabia; that wasn’t an attack on us. But we would certainly help them,” Trump added.He later told reporters on the South Lawn that any lethal U.S. military strike would be proportional to an Iranian one on an oil site.His overall comments, coupled with remarks from the Saudi government on Monday, could pump the brakes on any immediate march toward military action. Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry said it was inviting United Nations experts to investigate and would decide how to act based on those findings.The mere discussion of military action is a dramatic and rapid reversal from the previous week, when Trump seemed to be softening his Iran policy and suggested a possible meeting with Iranian leadership.That all changed on Saturday.Saudi Arabia’s Khurais oil field and Abqaiq oil processing plant were set ablaze in attacks that shut off half of the country’s oil exports, or 5 percent of the world’s supply, causing oil prices to spike.The Houthis, whom Saudi Arabia is fighting in neighboring Yemen’s civil war, said they carried out the latest attack using 10 drones.The Houthis have struck Saudi oil fields in the past, and threatened more attacks Monday, but Saturday’s attack was far more sophisticated than previous ones.U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft reiterated that position Monday at a Security Council meeting on Yemen, adding that “emerging information indicates that responsibility lies with Iran.”The president’s national security team briefed him Monday on the situation, Defense Secretary Mark EsperMark Esper2020 Democrats raise alarm about China's intellectual property theftTrump confirms death of Osama bin Laden's sonThe Hill's 12:30 Report: Sights and sounds from Houston debateMOREtweeted.Esper also said he spoke over the weekend with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Iraqi Defense Minister Najah al-Shammari.“The United States military, with our interagency team, is working with our partners to address this unprecedented attack and defend the international rules-based order that is being undermined by Iran,” Esper said.Administration officials have pointed to satellite imagery they say shows all the damage is on the northwest side of the sites, suggesting the strikes originated in Iraq or Iran rather than Yemen. They have not explained why drones couldn’t have circled around to strike from a different angle, but several reports citing unnamed officials say the attacks used both drones and cruise missiles.The Iraqi prime minister’s office said in a statement Monday that Pompeo assured Baghdad the United States has information confirming Iraqi territory was not used to launch the strike.The U.N. envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, told the Security Council on Monday that “it is not entirely clear who was behind the attack.” He added the situation is “frankly terrifying” because the incident “makes the chances of a regional conflict that much higher.”Iran has denied being behind the attack, with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani saying Monday that the attacks were a “reciprocal response” by the “Yemeni people” after “aggression against Yemen for years.”The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen said Monday that initial evidence shows the weapons used in the attack were Iranian and that the attack was not launched from Yemen, with the Saudi Foreign Ministry adding later that the origin is unknown.ADVERTISEMENTIn the days since the attack, Trump ratcheted back up his rhetoric against Iran.On Sunday, Trump vowed that the United States is “locked and loaded” and was just awaiting confirmation from Saudi Arabia on who carried out the attack.The following day he referenced Iran shooting down a U.S. drone in June — an incident that led Trump to nearly launch a military strike against Tehran.“Remember when Iran shot down a drone, saying knowingly that it was in their ‘airspace’ when, in fact, it was nowhere close,” Trump tweeted Monday. “They stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. We’ll see?”Less than a week ago, Trump seemed to be searching for a diplomatic off-ramp to tensions with Iran.Now, the odds of a meeting appear slim.Over the weekend, Trump denied he is willing to meet with Iran with no conditions, despite Pompeo and Mnuchin’s comments, as well as his June and July comments that he was willing to do so.And on Monday, Iran shut the door on a meeting, with a Foreign Ministry spokesman saying that “such a meeting will not take place.”Some of Trump’s allies in Congress are encouraging retaliation against Iran for the Saudi oil attacks.Even some Democrats have said the attack could warrant a military response.“Any attack against U.S. forces deployed abroad must be met with an overwhelming response — no targets are off the table,” Risch said in a statement.Other lawmakers are warning Trump he must seek congressional approval before acting.Udall was the lead Senate sponsor of an amendment to the annual defense policy bill meant to block Trump from taking military action against Iran. The amendment did not make it into the Senate version of the bill, but it did pass the House. Bicameral negotiations to reconcile the two versions are expected to officially start this week.“Congress needs a full intelligence briefing on this latest incident as quickly as possible,” Udall added. “And we must insist that the final National Defense Authorization Act — which is being negotiated right now — include my bipartisan amendment to prevent an unconstitutional war with Iran. Congress needs to act before President Trump launches us into an unauthorized, misguided military conflict in the Middle East to make up for his diplomatic failures.”"
网站,Protest likely to greet Trump fundraising trip in California,"RIO RANCHO, N.M. (AP) — President Donald Trump is making a rare visit to California, a Democratic stronghold where he is expected to rake in millions of dollars during a series of fundraisers for his reelection effort that are almost certain to be met with jeering protests.Trump has routinely mocked California over its liberal culture, policies and politics. His visit Tuesday and Wednesday signals that despite the state's decidedly leftward swing in recent years there are still plenty of wealthy Republicans who support him.""There's not been a president in living history that is as unpopular in the state of California as Trump,"" said Mike Madrid, a GOP political consultant who is an outspoken Trump critic. ""But our money spends the same as everyone else's.""Trump continues to rake in gobs of cash more than a year out from the November 2020 contest, with his campaign and the Republican National Committee pulling in over $210 million since the start of 2019, Federal Election Commission records show. That's more than all the current Democrats seeking to replace him raised combined during that period.The California events, which will be spread across two days in in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and San Diego, are expected to bring in an additional $15 million, according to a Republican official familiar with the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.California was an incubator for the modern conservative movement that swept the state's former governor, Ronald Reagan, into the White House in 1980. But demographic changes and an influx of new residents have helped drastically rework the political contours of the country's most populated state, with the former GOP stronghold of Orange County now home to more registered Democrats than Republicans. For Republicans, who have been resigned to political irrelevance at the state level, a donation to Trump can amount to its own form of protest.""By showing up to a fundraiser deep in the belly of the beast, one is saying: 'I don't care what the liberal politicians are saying and I want to show my support for him publicly,'"" said California's Republican National Committeewoman Harmeet Dhillon, who is an ardent Trump supporter. She added: ""I sold $100,000 worth of (tickets), and I could have sold another $100,000 more.""California has long been a key fundraising hotbed for politicians of both parties, which have relied on the entertainment industry and wealthy industry heads to finance their political ambitions. But under Trump, the run-of-the-mill fundraising trip has taken on a complicating dimension due to his harsh criticism of everything from the state's immigration laws to its forest management practices, which he blamed for fatal wildfires.Earlier this month Trump lashed out at ""Will and Grace"" TV star Debra Messing after she tweeted that attendees of the Trump's California fundraisers should be outed publicly.""I have not forgotten that when it was announced that I was going to do The Apprentice, and when it then became a big hit, helping NBC's failed lineup greatly, @DebraMessing came up to me at an Upfront & profusely thanked me, even calling me ""Sir."" How times have changed!"" Trump tweeted.In August, he took aim at the state's massive film industry, calling Hollywood ""very dangerous for our country.""""Hollywood is really terrible.

网站,Trump to visit Mexico border for groundbreaking,"7:50 HRS ISTBy Lalit K JhaWashington, Dec 27 (PTI) US President Donald Trump has said that he plans to visit the country's southwestern border with Mexico early next year for groundbreaking.Trump has made securing the southern border a focal point of his presidency, with plans to beef up border security and create a wall as key components.In an interaction with reporters during his surprise visit to Iraq with First Lady Melania, Trump said he wants to visit the border wall before the State of the Union Address next year.This is his first visit to Iraq as the US President.Trump said he is planning on ""going to the wall"" on the Southwest Border of the US early next year for a ""groundbreaking"".Trump made these remarks while taking questions from reporters during a briefing with US military leaders shortly after landing in Iraq.Trump indicated that he will not budge from his position on border wall. With the opposition Democrats refusing to approve the necessary funds, the federal government has been under a partial government shutdown for four days now.""Whatever it takes. We need a wall. We need safety for our country. Even from this standpoint. We have terrorists coming in through the southern border,"" Trump said when asked how long this shutdown would last."
网站,"Trump, Warren host massive rallies -- but 'anybody' can get Warren's crowds, Trump insists","closeVideoCan Trump flip New Mexico from blue to red in 2020?The Trump campaign says the key is winning over Hispanic voters in a state that hasn't been red since 2004.President Trump and Democratic contender Elizabeth Warren hosted dueling rallies on Monday that attracted massive crowds, setting off a war of words between the two candidates that underscored rising national enthusiasm heading into the 2020 election.Thousands of people packed under the marble arch of Manhattan's Washington Square Park to hear Warren, and her campaign estimated the attendance at 20,000-plus. Staffers also said that more than 5,000 people heard their candidate last week in Austin -- despite thunderstorms blowing in earlier in the day.But speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said of Warren's New York crowd, ""Anybody can do that.""""No. 1, she didn't have 20,000 people,"" the president said. ""And No. 2, I think anybody would get a good crowd there.""Attendees at Trump's rally, meanwhile, took up every seat at the 7,500-capacity Santa Ana Star Center in suburban Albuquerque, with throngs gathered in an overflow area outside. People lined up 13 hours in advance of the rally, and traffic around the arena was snarled, according to local reports.Trump, Warren attract massive crowds in dueling ralliesThousands of people packed under the marble arch of Manhattan's Washington Square Park to hear Warren, while more than 15,000 reportedly saw Trump in New Mexico.Local officials estimated that up to 15,000 people showed up to the rally in the Democratic-leaning state, which Trump lost by 8 points in the 2016 presidential election.The president is trying to turn New Mexico red as part of an aggressive new campaign strategy. Trump's first visit to the Land of Enchantment as president drew visitors from Colorado, California and all parts of New Mexico, according to local media.And Trump campaign officials said a campaign rally in nearby El Paso, Texas, last February was well attended by female and Hispanic voters and travelers from New Mexico, further suggesting that New Mexico is in play.Trump is looking to find the next Wisconsin or Michigan — states that Democrats generally win in presidential elections but that can surprise under certain conditions, as they did in 2016. Also on the Trump team's shortlist: Nevada, New Hampshire and Minnesota.Enthusiasm was apparent as the president touted New Mexico's economic successes and demanded the resignations of senior leadership at The New York Times following the paper's botched publication of a misleading accusation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Attendees enthusiastically chanted in response, ""Four more years!""“This is New Mexico. A lot of people in New Mexico really like Trump because he’s fighting for them,” an attendee told local station KRQE-13.For Warren, attracting her own large crowd without the benefit of incumbency took special effort.President Donald Trump arrives to speak at a campaign rally at the Santa Ana Star Center, Monday, Sept. 16, 2019, in Rio Rancho, N.M. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)The crowd was the product of a carefully planned, data-driven strategy to identify supporters, attract them to a rally and ultimately convert them into voters, a plan that goes well beyond producing a compelling scene for television.In an era where campaigns increasingly try to leverage technology to tactical advantage, the attention to detail by Warren's team stood out among her Democratic rivals.Like other candidates, her campaign invited past donors and other likely supporters who live nearby using email, mass text alerts and ""peer-to-peer"" text messages written by staffers before the event.But that's just the start. At the venue itself, attendees must line up and check in using their phones, even if they've previously RSVP'd. When finished, they're sent a picture of the senator's Golden Retriever, Bailey, which they show at the door to be issued a red-dot sticker proving they've complied.Warren's campaign spent months testing how best to collect information, trying out methods like different colors of paper signup sheets before settling on the current system since attendees get a doggie picture they're likely to enjoy.Democratic presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren takes the stage before addressing supporters at a rally, Monday, Sept. 16, 2019, in New York. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle)""It's efficient but also fun,"" said Tessa Simonds, the Warren campaign's director of grassroots mobilization.Warren has mastered the art of drawing thousands to her rallies, but, more importantly, those turning out are also a proxy for her recent rise in the polls. And the crowds have been building for weeks in places that have received relatively little attention from other candidates, including Seattle and Minneapolis.In 2016, the enormous crowds who flocked to see Bernie Sanders were an early sign of the enthusiasm that would build around his campaign and lead him to nearly defeat Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. This cycle, Sanders and other Democrats have also staged large rallies, but it is Warren who seems to hold the energy edge.Trump's large crowds four years ago hinted at his coming Election Day upset. Similarly, Barack Obama was still largely unknown nationally when he launched his presidential bid in 2007 — yet demonstrated his early strength by drawing 20,000 at a Super Bowl Sunday rally in Delaware.""When you get a big crowd and reporters are covering that and they're like, 'Wow, there's a lot of energy in the room,' ... that can absolutely get you free earned media,"" said Brendan Steinhauser, a Republican strategist and former top, conservative grassroots organizer. ""And if we learned anything from 2016, earned media is really valuable and can — pardon the pun — trump the paid media.""Democratic presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren addresses supporters at a rally at Washington Square Park, Monday, Sept. 16, 2019, in New York. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle)At the same time, big crowds aren't everything. Many Democrats bitterly remember throngs watching Clinton, Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi in front of Philadelphia's Independence Hall the night before Trump's 2016 victory. Democrat Walter Mondale attracted massive 1984 crowds in New York and Boston days before losing 49 out of 50 states (including New York and Massachusetts) to President Ronald Reagan.That's because large rallies can show enthusiasm, but often aren't good indicators of whether support is growing beyond a candidate's established base. The people who show up to such events tend to be self-selecting.""It's all reinforcing, the data, plus the visuals on TV feed more people in the crowds,"" said Joe Trippi, former campaign manager for Howard Dean, who organized early rallies large enough to briefly become a 2004 Democratic front-runner.But when voting began, it became clear that the former Vermont governor was more effective at building ballyhooed crowds than winning votes.""The issue is going to be, all that buzz on television and online, and the resources that it gets you, does that expand beyond that base support?"" Trippi asked. ""In the Dean campaign, it didn't. In Obama's it did.""Supporters of President Donald Trump cheer as he arrives to speak at a campaign rally at the Santa Ana Star Center, Monday, Sept. 16, 2019, in Rio Rancho, N.M. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)Judging crowd size is subjective, meanwhile, and can be so politically charged that police sometimes refuse to offer official estimates.Warren's campaign says its crowd-size estimates partially come from staffers and volunteers using counting clickers to gauge the number of attendees.The Warren campaign won't discuss its ""targeting"" of would-be supporters, nor would it touch analytical components like how many people it has on nationwide donor, volunteer or supporter lists. Aides concede they hope anyone invited to rallies will increase turnout by bringing friends, neighbors or relatives, but refuse to quantify how many new attendees such scenarios tend to generate.Still, attracting the crowd is only the beginning.Warren volunteers are trained as ""canvassers,"" asking event attendees to rank their top three Democratic presidential primary choices. The campaign won't say if it treats people leaning toward other candidates differently from avowed Warren supporters.Betting many will like what they see, Warren staffers follow up with rally-goers quickly, issuing text or email solicitations for donations or future volunteering — sometimes during or immediately after the event.In states where Warren's campaign has lots of staffers, like Iowa, large teams of organizers can easily make follow-up contact. In other places, including Austin, staff based at Warren's Boston headquarters travel to the area beforehand, hoping to convert rally attendees into future volunteers.Warren has become known for spending hours after each event taking ""selfies"" with attendees — and her staffers and volunteers work those lines, too, looking for future volunteers or people willing to try to recruit friends and neighbors to be supporters.Trump generally keeps a tighter schedule at his rallies. The president stayed in New Mexico on Monday night, then flew to the San Francisco Bay area on Tuesday for a luncheon fundraiser. He is expected to attend a fundraising dinner in the evening in Beverly Hills at the home of real estate developer Geoffrey Palmer.He has two more fundraisers planned in Los Angeles and San Diego on Wednesday.The fundraisers in left-wing strongholds will benefit Trump Victory, the joint entity that funds Trump's reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee.Fox News' Alex Pappas and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

(AP) — President Donald Trump rarely passes up the chance to throw a sharp elbow at left-leaning California, but he showed Tuesday he's more than happy to cash in there with a lunch-dinner-breakfast-lunch fundraising blitz expected to scoop up $15 million from wealthy Republicans in two days.""There's not been a president in living history that is as unpopular in the state of California as Trump,"" said Mike Madrid, a GOP political consultant who is an outspoken Trump critic.

The tweet included statistics about the state's unemployment rate and job creation.Talking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump got in some fresh digs about the state's problem with homelessness, saying, ""We can't let Los Angeles, San Francisco and numerous other cities destroy themselves by allowing what's happening.""""The people of San Francisco are fed up, and the people of Los Angeles are fed up. And we're looking at it, and we'll be doing something about it,"" he added.Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat, said ahead of Trump's arrival that he hoped the president would work with the city to end homelessness.

How times have changed!""In August, Trump took aim at the state's massive film industry, calling Hollywood ""very dangerous for our country.""""Hollywood is really terrible. You talk about racist — Hollywood is racist,"" he said.That's contributed to heightened security concerns surrounding the president's visit.Overall, Trump continues to rake in gobs of cash more than a year out from the November 2020 contest, with his campaign and the Republican National Committee pulling in more than $210 million since the start of 2019, Federal Election Commission records show. That's more than all the current Democrats seeking to replace him raised combined during that period.The visit this week marks Trump's fourth visit to the state during his presidency. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson is expected to follow Trump to California, one day behind the president, with visits to San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego. A senior HUD official said Carson would speak on a range of issues, including increasing the supply of affordable housing and promoting investment in distressed communities.———Slodysko reported from Washington.

网站,Trump Not Ready to Visit North Korea,"In comments Monday to reporters, President Trump said that he is ?not ready? to visit North Korea to hold direct talks with Kim Jong Un. He declined to elaborate beyond that.Trump was asked about this because South Korean media reported that in his August letter, Kim had invited Trump to visit Pyongyang, which would?ve potentially been a chance to get the denuclearization talks restarted.Even though Trump and Kim had once said they were willing to visit one anothers? countries, Pyongyang apparently is not where the next stage is happening. While the US has said they are very interested in more talks, there is as yet no plan on going anywhere specific.That Trump had last met Kim in the demilitarized zone of Korea likely lent itself to the suggestion Pyongyang might be on the table. Trump has suggested he hopes for talks by the end of the year, but has provided no indication where he might be comfortable having them.Author: Jason DitzJason Ditz is news editor of Antiwar.com.

网站,Trump seeks to spring upset in New Mexico next year,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump headed to New Mexico on Monday for a campaign rally that demonstrates his efforts to capture a few more Democratic-leaning states in next year's presidential election.Trump's rally in Rio Rancho, in suburban Albuquerque, will be the first stop on a three-day swing that will also take him to California for fundraisers expected to raise more than $15 million.Trump is looking to find the next Wisconsin or Michigan — states that Democrats generally win in presidential elections but that can surprise under certain conditions, as they did in 2016.New Mexico has not voted for a Republican in the presidential election since 2004. Trump captured just 40% of the state vote in 2016. Hillary Clinton also fell short of a majority victory, with 48% support in a state she did not visit.Still, campaign officials say a Trump rally in nearby El Paso, Texas, last February was well attended by female and Hispanic voters and travelers from New Mexico, indicating to them that New Mexico is in play. Hundreds of people showed up early Monday to claim a place in line ahead of the evening event in Rio Rancho. Protesters, for their part, vowed to step up acts of civil disobedience and demonstrations.""We have the opportunity because of our fundraising and infrastructure to not only defend the states we carried in 2016, but to extend the map in 2020,"" said Rick Gorka, a spokesman for a fundraising committee for Trump's reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee.Gorka said New Mexico is a big part of that strategy, as are Minnesota, New Hampshire and Nevada.Trump's efforts in New Mexico will provide a test of how well his often-harsh rhetoric about immigrants will play with Hispanic voters, who comprise nearly 40% of New Mexico's electorate.Trump is likely to cite his efforts to boost oil and gas production in his bid to win over voters. New Mexico is in the midst of an oil-production boom that has boosted employment and spurred a state government spending spree from first-year Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on public education, roadway projects and tax rebates for film productions.Lujan Grisham took aim at Trump ahead of his visit, describing the president as being demeaning to Hispanics and immigrants since being elected. She also said Trump's policies had resulted in increased taxes for some New Mexicans.Trump will follow up his rally by flying to the San Francisco Bay area on Tuesday for a luncheon fundraiser. He'll then attend a fundraising dinner that evening in Beverly Hills at the home of real estate developer Geoffrey Palmer. He has two more fundraisers planned in Los Angeles and San Diego on Wednesday.The fundraisers will benefit Trump Victory, the joint entity that funds Trump's reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee.———Associated Press staff writer Morgan Lee contributed to this report from Santa Fe, New Mexico."

网站,Trump discusses defence treaty with Netanyahu,"US president Donald Trump said Saturday he and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the possibility of moving forward on a ‘mutual defense’ treaty between the allies, just three days before Israeli voters go to the polls.‘I had a call today with prime minister Netanyahu to discuss the possibility of moving forward with a Mutual Defence Treaty, between the United States and Israel,’ Trump tweeted.He said such an agreement would ‘further anchor the tremendous alliance’ between the two countries.‘I look forward to continuing those discussions after the Israeli Elections when we meet at the United Nations later this month!’ Trump added, giving a tacit last-minute endorsement to Netanyahu’s re-election bid.Taking to the same medium, Netanyahu thanked ‘his dear friend’ Trump.‘The Jewish State has never had a greater friend in the White House,’ the Israeli premier tweeted.‘I look forward to our meeting at the UN to advance a historic Defence Treaty between the United States and Israel.’Netanyahu also pledged to ‘continue full steam ahead with our common battle against terrorism,’ congratulating Trump ‘on your latest success against Bin Laden’s son.’Trump had earlier in the day confirmed that Hamza bin Laden, the son and designated heir of al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden, was killed in a counter-terrorism operation in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.The comments come as the international community awaits the release of Washington’s long-delayed Middle East peace plan, which secretary of state Mike Pompeo recently said could come within weeks.Its publication was pushed back after Israel scheduled new elections, set for Tuesday.Then last week, one of the key architects of the US plan, Jason Greenblatt, announced his resignation.Trump has repeatedly boasted that he is the most pro-Israeli US president in history. He has slashed aid to the Palestinians, while making big concessions to the Israelis, including formalising US recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish state.As a result, the Palestinian Authority has cut off formal contact with the Trump administration, saying it is not an honest broker.So far, Trump has not commented on Netanyahu’s controversial pledge to annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank as well as the Jordan Valley if re-elected - which would seem to go beyond US proposals for land swaps between Israel and the Palestinians.Netanyahu, 69, is fighting his second election in five months with a potential corruption indictment looming. He suffered a major defeat in April, when his Likud party along with its right-wing and religious allies won a majority, but he failed to form a coalition."

网站,"Trump, Trade and China","Photograph Source: The White House from Washington, DC – Public DomainRarely a day passes when one or another U.S. ruling class institution or personality fails to criticize President Trump’s unilateral imposition of ever increasing and broad-ranging protective tariffs against Chinese imports. Trump’s critics include the Democratic Party as well as leading Republicans, the prestigious corporate “newspaper of record,” The New York Times and the aptly dubbed “ruling class think tank,” the Council on Foreign Relations. The latter’s September/October 2019 Foreign Affairs, headlined, “How A Global Trading System Dies,” features five articles and essays warning U.S. policy makers against Trump’s course.The titles themselves are indicative of Foreign Affairs’ viewpoint. They include: “The Sources of Chinese Conduct: Are Washington and Beijing Fighting a New Cold War?” and “Competition Without Catastrophe: How America Can Both Challenge and Coexist With China” as well as “Trump’s Assault on the Global Trading System And Why Decoupling from China Will Change Everything.”All Trump’s trade policy critics begin with the proposition that China today operates on the world stage as a leading capitalist power, indeed as a leading imperialist power with ever-increasing intentions to dominate world markets to the disadvantage of its competitors.Nothing new here! In the world of high stakes globalized imperialist competition, there are no friendly players or permanent “historic allies.” Indeed, Trump’s imposition of major tariffs include painful measures inflicted against its traditional European allies, including France, Germany, Italy and England, as well as Canada and Mexico. To date estimates of Trump’s tariffs, imposed or to be imposed in stages at rates from 10% to 15% and even 30%, have been levied on Chinese, European, Canadian and Mexican imports valued at close to $700 billion, the great proportion of which are aimed at China. But with regard to all these effected nations, who have retaliated with their own tariffs against U.S. exports to their nations, Trump’s critics share the view that unlike the Cold War “containment” and isolation strategies imposed on the Soviet Union for some 70 years prior to its restoration of capitalism in the late 1980s and early 1990s, China, with a Gross Domestic Product ranked second in the world at 63 percent of the U.S. GDP, and the largest trading partner with more than half the world’s nations, cannot and must not be excluded from the world marketplace.Workings of the WTODependent on world trade to export their commodities outside their own limited domestic markets, Trump’s critics seek to engage U.S. competitors in broad-ranging negotiations via the aegis of the World Trade Organizations (WTO) and similar international bodies as opposed to Trump’s belief that he can unilaterally bludgeon competitors into submitting to his dictates, usually in accord with the specific interests of various components of the U.S. ruling class closest to or beholden to Trump’s personal circles.The U.S.-led Cold War policies of previous decades were aimed at the Soviet Union from the time of the 1917 Russian Revolution and continuing through the post-WWII period when Eastern Europe, via the Soviet Union’s defeat of the largely German occupied and pro-Hitler capitalist governments there, laid the basis for extricating this huge swath of Europe from capitalist domination. Imperialism’s fear that the Soviet workers’ state’s abolition of private property, its original world revolutionary intentions and its instituting a monopoly of foreign trade aimed at preventing world imperialism from undermining its nascent domestic economy with superior technologies and commodities were central to U.S. policies. The seventy-plus years of the U.S. Cold War were aimed at bringing down the Soviet state and its Eastern European counterparts as well as China and Vietnam. In Western Europe, where the wartime governments in France and Italy embraced and collaborated with the German Nazis occupation, the immediate post war period was marked by massive working class mobilizations that posed a serious threat to capitalist rule and led to major victories that persist to this day, including systems of free health care and major extensions of union and workers’ rights. Similarly, the 1946 post war U.S. strike wave, the largest in history, saw millions take to the streets to close down major U.S. industries demanding union recognition and an end to the wartime wage freeze that had brought unprecedented profits to the warmakers’ military-industrial behemoth and misery to the working class majority. A frightened U.S. ruling class, fearful that Europe’s mass anti-capitalist worker mobilization would inspire similar challenges to capitalist prerogatives, but untainted with Nazis collaboration as in France and Italy, launched the infamous McCarthy era witch hunt aimed at purging socialists and communists from leadership positions in the growing trade union movement.China’s 1949-54 revolution eventually abolished capitalist property relations and ended the centuries of world imperialist division, exploitation and colonization of the Chinese people. As with the ending of capitalist rule in the USSR and Eastern Europe, the U.S. and the imperialist world more generally sought restoration and/or expansion of its “interests” in all these states, using ever-increasing military measures (NATO), overt intervention in China during the Korean War, sanctions, embargoes, and economic isolation, coupled with CIA secret wars, assassinations and industrial sabotage.Stalinism’s role in Russia and ChinaThey were aided in these efforts by the ceaseless disputes that emerged between the Stalinist-led bureaucratic regimes in China and the USSR, both of which periodically sought “peaceful co-existence” alliances with U.S. imperialism against each other as opposed to advancing the interests of the world’s working masses. The Russians, under Stalin, demanded that the Chinese refrain from alienating the defeated Chinese capitalists in 1949 by nationalizing their property and repeatedly insisted on Russian ownership of disputed border areas in the Chinese East. The Chinese under Mao Zedong, armed and financed U.S. and apartheid South African-backed “guerilla fighters” in efforts to overthrow the Russian-allied Angolan government. The infamous 1972 Nixon-Mao meeting in Beijing at the height of the U.S. genocidal war against Vietnam informed world opinion that China preferred an alliance with U.S. imperialism as a counter to its rivalry with the USSR – the Vietnamese liberation war be damned! China was the first nation to recognize the fascist-like Augusto Pinochet government of Chile that came to power in 1973 via a U.S.-supported military coup. China’s heinous 1979 invasion and war against Vietnam, in retaliation for Vietnam’s 1978 invasion of Cambodia to stop the mass murder of millions of Cambodian workers and peasant at the hands of the China-allied Pol Pot regime was yet another horrific example of China’s “Russia [not U.S. imperialism] is the main danger” thesis. Russia’s Stalinists too pulled out all the stops to advance their “nationalist” interests against China, not to mention Russia’s reactionary invasions of Hungary (1956) and Czechoslovakia (1968) aimed at smashing working class rebellions against Stalinist rule.Beginning with the 1979 rise to power in China of the capitalist-restorationist regime of Deng Xiaoping China’s Stalinist leaders signaled world imperialism that it was more than willing to re-open its nation to imperialist penetration and plunder. A decade later the Russian Stalinists too submitted to massive imperialist penetration and facilitated a capitalist restoration process that brought untold misery to the Russian people.China enters the WTOConvinced that capitalist restoration in China was the order of the day, in 2001 the U.S. ended all aspects of hostility toward China and presided over China’s admission to the WTO. The terms were simple enough; China would allow U.S. corporations to set up shop and employ endless numbers of Chinese workers at near slave wages and using state-of-the-art technologies to produce unprecedented numbers of commodities for the U.S. and world marketplace. This super-exploitation of Chinese labor had the effect of temporarily boosting declining U.S. profit rates, closing non-competitive U.S. factories and freezing or reducing U.S. wage rates – a ten-plus year bonanza for U.S. corporations, which happily shipped back to the U.S. Chinese made commodities from U.S.–owned factories at near zero tariff rates. Indeed, U.S. tariff rates at some 1.5 percent or zero on most Chinese imports were among the lowest in the world. And why not? Historically, tariffs are imposed by nations with inferior technologies that cannot effectively compete on world markets. The age-old debate between protectionists and free traders always comes down to which nations need protection and which need total and unobstructed access to world markets. In the eighteen some odd years since China was admitted to the WTO China went from operating as one of the world’s lowest technology nations to today, when Chinese technology rivals or exceeds most all other nations on earth. In the past 20-plus years China, for example, went from providing “internal migrant” teenage girls from the Chinese countryside working in prison like foreign-owned dormitory factories at six cents per hour and seven days a week producing garments to China today – a nation with some of the most modern factories in the world producing world class industrial tools and machinery and state-of-the-art 5G (fifth generation) electronics and telecommunication products. Super high tech 5G Chinese corporations like Huawei are today capable of challenging and exceeding the world’s most sophisticated operations.

网站,"Trump: Probe Obama, Not Me","President Donald Trump sent out a tweet on Monday that the House Judiciary Committee should not launch an impeachment inquiry against him, but instead examine former President Barack Obama’s business deals since leaving the White House.The president belittled the probe against him, tweeting that the “House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report, sadly for them after two years and $40,000,000 spent - ZERO COLLUSION, ZERO OBSTRUCTION. So they say, OK, lets look at everything else, and all of the deals that ‘Trump’ has done over his lifetime.”The president continued in another tweet that “I have a better idea. Look at the Obama Book Deal, or the ridiculous Netflix deal. Then look at all the deals made by the Dems in Congress, the 'Congressional Slush Fund,' and lastly the IG Reports. Take a look at them. Those investigations would be over FAST!”Trump was referring to the first film recently distributed by the former president and first lady Michelle Obama’s production company, High Ground through a joint venture with Netflix, according to Raw Story.Vice pointed out that in contradiction to Trump’s claim, the committee has not given up on the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.Last week the panel voted to expand its impeachment probe, and moved to get its hands on former special counsel Robert Mueller’s most sensitive materials."
网站,"Trump says US, Japan reach initial agreement on tariffs","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said his administration has reached an initial trade accord with Japan over tariffs and that he intends to enter into the agreement in coming weeks.In a notice to Congress on Monday, Trump also said the U.S. will be entering an “executive agreement” with Japan over digital trade. There was no mention by Trump if he will end his threat to slap tariffs on Japanese auto imports as part of the trade deal.“My administration looks forward to continued collaboration with the Congress on further negotiations with Japan to achieve a comprehensive trade agreement that results in more fair and reciprocal trade between the United States and Japan,” Trump said in the statement released by the White House via email.After meeting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the G-7 summit in France last month, Trump announced that the two countries had struck a trade deal “in principle.” The leaders said they hoped to sign the pact on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York later this month.U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has said the limited trade deal will cover agriculture, industrial tariffs and digital trade. The USTR said Monday it had no further comment and Trump provided no details about what was in the initial deal.Under an earlier proposal, Japan would cut tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, including beef, pork, dairy products, wine and ethanol. The U.S. would cut levies on some Japanese industrial products, but not on cars. Japanese media has reported that the sides had agreed to lower tariffs on U.S. beef and pork to levels offered to members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Abe agreed to direct talks in September 2018 after Trump hit Japan’s steel and aluminum exports with tariffs and threatened to do the same on all imported cars, including those made in Japan.Trump earlier this year delayed a decision until November over whether to impose new levies of as high as 25% on imported vehicles over national security grounds to allow more time for talks with Japan and the European Union.———©2019 Bloomberg NewsVisit Bloomberg News at www.bloomberg.com—————PHOTO (for help with images, contact 312-222-4194): USJAPAN-TARIFFS"
网站,Trump targets border state with rally amid defiant Democrats,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Donald Trump lost New Mexico by 8 percentage points in 2016. Last year, his party lost a House seat and the governor's mansion. Last week, a congressional candidate went viral by taunting the president by name in an ad.Still, Trump is headed to New Mexico on Monday for a campaign rally that is making some politicos scratch their heads.Is New Mexico, a state that hasn't voted for a Republican for president since George W. Bush 2004, in play? The Trump campaign argues yes and has put it — along with Nevada, New Hampshire and Minnesota — on the short list of states that Trump lost in 2016 and is plotting to win in 2020. New Mexico is an especially ambitious goal, one that may ride on Trump's strength in rural America and fall on his failure to win over Hispanics.""Bush had much higher favorable opinions by Hispanics,"" said Lonna Atkeson, a political science professor at the University of New Mexico, who noted Bush defeated Sen. John Kerry 15 years ago by winning over large rural swaths of the state. ""He was from Texas, not New York, and so he had more regional ties ... Trump paints a very different portrait.""Atkeson doesn't see Trump going far politically in a state with the highest concentration of Latinos in the U.S.Among those waiting for the president in New Mexico is former CIA operative Valerie Plame, the top contender in a crowded Democratic primary race for New Mexico's northern congressional district. Plame notes she has a ""few scores to settle"" with the president in a swaggering new video that shows her speeding across the desert in a muscle car — in reverse — before spinning forward in a swirl of dust.Viewed a million times on YouTube within days, the ad flickers with a newsreel-style montage of Plame's thwarted undercover career at keeping nukes from terrorists — tied quickly to Trump's presidential pardon of the man convicted of lying to investigators about the 2003 leak of Plame's covert identity by an official in the George W. Bush administration. That was apparent retribution for her then-husband Joe Wilson's opposition to the Iraq War.""I know how Washington works, unfortunately, and I can get to work on day one,"" Plame told The Associated Press. ""I've stopped a long time ago trying to figure him (Trump) out. Who knows?""Trump used a recent rally in North Carolina to try and stoke Republican's enthusiasm for Dan Bishop, on the eve of the congressional candidate's narrow election victory in a do-over vote after 2018 midterm results were tossed out on fraud concerns.Trump's plans for Monday are reminiscent of his May 2016 rally at a convention center in Albuquerque that touched off protests and outdoor scenes of burning T-shirts, bottle-throwing and police tear gas. Inside, Trump spoke of local welfare dependency and said better work was needed from then-Gov. Susana Martinez — who skipped the rally and long wavered as a Republican in supporting Trump.He will arrive this time to a state in the midst of an oil-production boom that has boosted employment and spurred a state government spending spree from first-year Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on public education, roadway projects and tax rebates to film productions.Lujan Grisham has pilloried Trump's border wall while withdrawing most National Guard troops from the border and suing the U.S. Homeland Security Department to recoup spending by local governments to shelter and feed asylum-seeking migrants released into southern New Mexico towns such as Las Cruces and Deming.The Trump administration has seized on the local oil industry's vigor as a hallmark of America's ""energy renaissance,"" and shown an interest in a congressional candidate — Claire Chase of Roswell — who has professional and family ties to oil producer Mack Energy and the dynasty that runs it. She's one of three Republicans seeking to challenge Rep. Xochitl Torres Small, who narrowly won the state's open southern seat in 2018 on a centrist Democratic platform.In August, Vice President Mike Pence declared New Mexico was back ""in play"" politically in a visit to the Permian Basin, a booming petroleum production zone overlapping portions of southern New Mexico and western Texas.Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said he believes the president's standing has improved since 2016. He credited the economy, including the fact that Latino unemployment is at an all-time low, as well as the president's stance on immigration enforcement.""The most valuable commodity that we have as a campaign is the president's time. And he will not travel all the way to New Mexico for a head fake,"" Murtaugh said.But Trump has considerable work cut out for him to gain ground in New Mexico. He captured just 40% of the state vote in 2016. Hillary Clinton also fell short of a majority victory with 48% support in a state she did not visit. That leaves a question mark hovering above 9% of voters who sided with Libertarian former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson.Dennis Roch, a rural school district superintendent who served as a Republican in the state House for a decade before retiring last year, said the state's Republican Party has overcome sizeable voter-registration deficits over the years with anti-crime initiatives, an affinity for the military and an anti-tax fervor for less-restrictive government that appeals to the state's frontier ethos.""It could go for Trump — there are a lot of people in the east end of the state that are very passionate about Second Amendment rights,"" said Roch, who noted he's not working with the campaign. ""There are people on the southern end that are affected in a real way by border security.""The governor's office has consistently swung back and forth from Democratic to Republican control for decades. In 2014, the GOP won a state House majority for the first time in decades. Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Domenici, now deceased, served six terms before retiring 2007 — though the state's Washington delegation today is entirely Democratic.The state's urban-rural political divide has been on prominent display as sheriffs in dozens of counties this year threatened not to enforce new gun control measures, including background checks on most private gun sales, from the Democratic-led Legislature that were signed by Lujan Grisham.In a vast northern congressional district, Plame is vying for the Democratic nomination against 10 other candidates, including 36-year-old District Attorney Marco Serna, who has pursued alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent drug offenders in a region ravaged by heroin and prescription opioids, and social-justice minded attorney Teresa Leger Fernandez. Three Republicans are running in the Democratic stronghold.The winner in 2020 replaces Rep. Ben Ray Luján, who is running in an open Senate primary to replace retiring Democrat Tom Udall.Luján emerged as a nemesis to Trump as he led the House Democrats' campaign arm to help recapture a majority of seats in 2018 with an ethnically diverse slate of candidates, including Congress' first-ever female Native American representatives from Albuquerque and Kansas. He's competing against Democratic Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, while the Republican Senate primary still lacks a top-tier candidate.Luján will speak at a counter-rally by Democrats in Albuquerque on Monday, just before Trump takes the stage.He greeted news of Trump's rally in New Mexico at first with mocking disbelief, and then a series of stern warnings on Twitter: ""Rio Rancho is in my district, and anyone who undermines the safety, security, or way of life of our communities, isn't welcome here.""———Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report."

网站,Fake news reports try to pin Obama leaks on Trump,"Here’s some advice for the media covering President Trump: If you don’t want to be accused of reporting fake news, don’t report fake news.Case in point: On Monday, CNN correspondent Jim Sciutto reported that a highly placed U.S. intelligence source inside the Kremlin was pulled “in part, by concerns that President Donald Trump and his administration repeatedly mishandled classified intelligence and could contribute to exposing the covert source as a spy.” Sciutto continued, “The decision to carry out the extraction occurred soon after a May 2017 meeting in the Oval Office in which Trump discussed highly classified intelligence with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and then-Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak … [that] had been provided by Israel.”Sorry, the decision to extract the source was first made before Trump took office, and the reason was mishandling of classified intelligence not by Trump but by the Obama administration. As the New York Times reported “C.I.A. officials worried about safety made the arduous decision in late 2016 to offer to extract the source from Russia.” What prompted that decision? Leaks to the media about the covert source’s reporting that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered and orchestrated Russia’s 2016 U.S. presidential election interference campaign.The impetus for the extraction decision was a Dec. 14, 2016, NBC News report that “two senior officials with direct access to the information” said Putin personally directed Russia’s election interference and “the intelligence came from diplomatic sources and spies working for U.S. allies, the officials said.” NBC News added that this new intelligence showing Putin’s direct involvement went much further than the information the United States was relying on when all 17 intelligence agencies issued a report in October holding Russia responsible for the Democratic National Committee hack and that “now the U.S. has solid information tying Putin to the operation.”This leak exposed the fact that the CIA had a spy in Putin’s orbit who was passing on intelligence about the Russian president’s decision-making. Who leaked the information? Two senior Obama administration officials. The Times reports that Obama CIA Director John O. Brennan considered the Kremlin source’s reporting “so delicate, and the need to protect the source’s identity so important,” that he kept his reports out of the President’s Daily Brief and sent them to President Barack Obama in “special sealed envelopes to the Oval Office.” Yet the leak, according to NBC News, came from officials “with direct access to the information.” Which Obama aide leaked it? That is for John Durham, the U.S. attorney tasked with investigating the origins of the FBI’s Russia probe, to find out, but this much is certain: It was not Donald Trump.It was after this Obama administration leak that the CIA first decided to pull the source.That’s not all. CNN falsely reported that the source was pulled after Trump’s meeting with Russia officials in which he shared intelligence on Syria that was “provided by Israel.” But as I pointed out in May 2017, Trump did not reveal that Israel was the source of the intelligence. That piece of classified information was revealed to the Times by what the paper described “a current and a former American official familiar with how the United States obtained the information.” Any former official familiar with that intelligence was from the Obama administration. So this leak also came from Team Obama. Even Brennan, the Obama CIA director and virulent Trump critic, admitted that Trump was not to blame and said “the real damage to national security is … what was leaked in the aftermath, what was put in the media.”So, CNN tried to blame Trump for the loss of a Kremlin source, when it was really the Obama administration that was responsible for the catastrophic leaks that burned him — and did so by in part citing a leak that did not come from Trump at all but most likely from a former Obama official.Talk about fake news. Yet, despite all of this, CNN has not pulled its “fake news” story. Indeed, Sciutto still has it proudly pinned at the top of his Twitter feed. What a disgrace.Marc A. Thiessen is a syndicated columnist."
